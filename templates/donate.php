                <p>Hundreds of individuals have joined together to invest their time, energy, ideas, and money in our fellows and in our mission. Together we are building a movement that changes the way our cities function -- a movement that helps cities to keep pace with their community and interact with residents using new tools and technologies.</p>
                
                <p>Code for America is generously supported by leaders in philanthropy and technology. Their support makes our work possible. It allows for us to connect city governments with web and design talent.</p>
