                        <p>Denver is the largest city and the capital of Colorado. Known for its 5,280 feet elevation and set against the backdrop of the Rocky Mountains, the Mile High City is known for its picturesque setting. The City is the home to tech companies like Pivotal Labs, SendGrid and McAffe, as well as early-stage incubators like Galvanize. Denverâ€™s Code for America Brigade brings together 37 members of the community (many from these major tech companies) to engage in regular hackathons and discussions.
