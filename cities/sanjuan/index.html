                        <p>San Juan is the capital and most populous city in Puerto Rico, an unincorporated territory of the United States. As its Spanish name suggests, the area is known for its wealthy seaport and is the island’s center for manufacturing, finance, culture and tourism. Puerto Rico’s govtech scene is growing rapidly as it recently enacted an <a href="http://www2.pr.gov/cio/Politicas%20y%20Procedimientos/Guia%20TIG-016.pdf">API policy</a> where all agencies are expected to develop APIs for better transparency and data integration.</p>
                        <p>In June 2013, the region also hosted the first <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ89LBlnSEM">Puerto Rico TechSummit</a> where an adjacent hackathon brought out more than 200 developers and produced more than <a href="http://artzub.com/ghv/#user=commonwealth-of-puerto-rico">30 projects</a>. As the city moves into its 2014 fellowship year, we aim to support Puerto Rico’s efforts in citizen engagement and greater government transparency.</p>

                        As CIO for the Government of Puerto Rico and in conjunction with key CIO’s from local government agencies, we represent a young breed of experts looking to establish a new vision on how technology can be implemented and designed to scale as a new government platform.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We believe that technology must be leveraged to directly influence government agility and economic development strategies.
