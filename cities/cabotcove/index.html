                        <p>To commemorate the 2013 National Day of Civic Hacking and <a href="http://vegashack.com/">VegasHack</a>, the City of Las Vegas released an <a href="http://lasvegas.opendata.junar.com/home/">open data portal</a> with information on employee compensation, service requests, business licenses, development service projects and census data.The city is currently in talks to create an open data policy and at the time of the Mayor’s Innovation Summit, Mayor Goodman committed to using the <a href="http://housefacts.me/">housefacts</a> data standard to publish information on residential house, safety inspections and unsafe housing conditions. Vegas is currently working on building out its Code for America Brigade. Brigade Captains&nbsp;Shawn Looker and Ryan Quinn have recently stepped forward to take over.

                        With an aging community and a dwindling industry, it's high time Cabot Cove became a more creative place. We're excited to work with Code for America to push our town into modern world.

                <p>Cabot Cove is a small fishing village in Maine, who's principle industry is fishing.  Despite the close-knit nature of the community there, the town suffers from an unusually high homicide rate, peaking in the years 1984 to 1996, exacerbated by an understaffed police force.</p>
                <p>Whilst shadowing the local police force on their daily beat, the team met with many local residents, including a retired teacher who took great interest in their work with the police force.  After further intensive user research and interviews, it became clear to the group that retirees had little to do in the village.</p>
