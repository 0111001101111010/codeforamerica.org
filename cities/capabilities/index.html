            <p>Through four years of experimenting and learning through the Code for America Fellowship in 32 local governments, as well as lighter partnerships with dozens more through our Brigade and Peer Network program, we’ve seen that there’s a set of key capabilities that help cities fully take advantage of the Fellowship engagement.</p>

            <p>These capabilities enable Fellowship partners to effectively use technology and data to address social and community issues and embrace a culture of learning and innovative problem-solving. When these capabilities are in place, cities can better leverage modern technology tools and approaches to foster collaboration and build trust between residents and their government — and rise to meet the challenges they face today and tomorrow.</p>

            <p>It is not necessary for any one city to employ all of these approaches, or to be strong in all areas before embarking on a Fellowship; in our experience, cities that possess some combination of these capabilities and deliberately invest in building others over the course of the year get the most out of their Fellowship engagement.</p>

           <p>Below we’ve outlined these capabilities, as well as examples of what other cities have done to build their capabilities and how other cities could adapt these approaches.</p>
