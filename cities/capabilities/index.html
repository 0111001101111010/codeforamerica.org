            <p>Through four years of experimenting and learning through the Code for America Fellowship in 32 local governments, we’ve seen that there’s a set of key capabilities that help cities fully take advantage of the Fellowship engagement.</p>

            <p>When these capabilities are in place, we've observed  that cities are better equipped to embrace a culture of innovative problem-solving, apply modern tools and approaches to address community needs, and leverage technology and data to foster collaboration with residents.</p>

            <p>It is not necessary for any one city to employ all of these approaches; in our experience, cities that possess some combination of these capabilities and deliberately invest in building others over the course of the year get the most out of their Fellowship engagement.</p>
