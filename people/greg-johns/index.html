	    <p class="p-note">Greg Johns (Finance Manager) has worked in a wide range of industries over the course of his career.  He began his career in the New York City area where he worked at an one of the first companies to offer online brokerage services and extended his career into investment research working at Smith Barney, Wall Street Strategies, and Moody’s Investors Service, where he covered a wide range of industry sectors.  After several years of work in corporate finance and investment research, he took a “radical sabbatical” and moved to Sonoma, CA with his wife to run a bed and breakfast.  During that time, he also worked as a Small Business Advisor for the Small Business Development Center and as Business Director for the Sonoma Ecology Center.  At the end of his radical sabbatical, he and his family moved to Berkeley, CA and he took a position at Room to Read in the finance department where among other things, he worked with country teams in southern Africa on their budgeting, financial reporting, and business financial analysis.  Greg holds a Bachelor’s in Business Administration degree from Howard University and a MBA from the University of Michigan.</p>
