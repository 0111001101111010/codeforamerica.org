	    <p class="p-note">A former research analyst turned software developer living in the heart of the bluegrass, Chase has a fondness and a passion for science and technology especially at the intersection of disciplines like biology and computer science. His interest in Open Data certainly stems from a decade in academia, it was a chance encounter with some folks from the Sunlight Foundation that sparked his desire to be a local advocate and civic hacker in beautiful Lexington, Kentucky. Since 2010, Chase has helped lead a group of like-minded civic hackers to help empower citizens through data. When not hacking, he is enjoys his time playing various stringed instruments and enjoying the bluegrass with his family.</p>
