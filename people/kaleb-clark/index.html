	    <p class="p-note">I have been working professionally in the Information Technology community for over 15 years primarily as Unix / Linux administrator and Network Engineer. Working with and deploying open source software in corporate, and government IT shops since 1998. Early in my career I discovered the power of the Perl programming language primarily for parsing logs, debug information as well as corporate data, and of course web development. LAMP finally hit the scene, and I have been creating internal apps ever since. This has evolved into many other web development platforms such as PHP, Rails, Javascript and more. Currently I am pushing more policy to staff, than firmware updates to switches.
