	    <p class="p-note">I've grown up in west Anchorage and still think Alaska is the best place to live after traveling around the US and nearly every state.  </p>	    <p>I studied chemistry and biology at the University of Alaska Fairbanks and the Evergreen State College. I now work in the genetics laboratory in the state department of Fish and Game.  Going into the field for sample collection along with the laboratory work to make sense of the data collected is very rewarding to me.  </p>	    <p>In my free time I like to use my knowledge in scientific coding in the R language to collect data that is public and freely available on the web to create new tools for understanding the community.  I've been playing recently with crime map data, the annual finance reporting for municipalities, and the financial records of political campaigning.  After the beginning of the recession, I needed to find a way to apply myself to understand the institutional misunderstandings that led to a bruising of the economy.  Using R for analytics is one way for me to answer the questions that I've had.  </p>
