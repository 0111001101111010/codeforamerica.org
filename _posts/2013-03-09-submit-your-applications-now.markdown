From the stage of  SXSW, Jennifer Pahlka (CfA's fearless leader) announced to the crowd of would-be geeks, that we're now accepting applications for our 2013 Accelerator and 2014 Fellowship. (If you missed Jen's SXSW keynote last year, you can <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/sxsw" target="_blank">listen to it here</a>.)

As you probably know, the <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/fellows" target="_blank">Code for America Fellowship</a> pairs developers and designers who are passionate about using their skills to give back, with local governments. While embedded in the municipality the fellows collaborate with municipal leaders and community members to create and implement web applications, and explore new approaches to local challenges. (For example, the 2012 New Orleans team focused on the issue of urban blight, building <a href="http://blightstatus.com" target="_blank">http://BlightStatus.com</a>, a much-need tool that has helped both the community and government assess the city’s vacant housing.)

So who are these Fellows? Check out the 2011 class <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/2011-fellows" target="_blank">here</a>, the 2012 class <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/2012-fellows" target="_blank">here</a>, and the current class <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/2013-fellows" target="_blank">here</a>. Impressive, right? In short, they're a group of passionate citizens who left good jobs at companies like Google, Apple, <em>Newsweek</em>, and ESRI to join the "Peace Corps for Geeks."

For the 2014 cycle, the Code for America Fellowship is looking for web developers, designers, product managers, data scientists, and entrepreneurs who are passionate about enhancing their communities, and want to use their skill to give back. The 2014 program will begin on January 2014; the deadline for applications is July 31, 2013.

Applications are being accepted online here: <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/apply">http://codeforamerica.org/apply</a>.

We are still recruiting cities for the 2014 program as well, and time is running out. The deadline is March 31; <a href="/cities">learn more and apply here</a>.

I'm also pleased to share that Code for America is also now recruiting startups for the <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/accelerator">CfA Accelerator</a> program — a first-of-its-kind, four-month program that "turbo-charges" civic startups by providing them a springboard to amplify market awareness of their product, additional funding, business mentoring specific to the “government 2.0” space, and introductions to a broad network of civic leaders and potential investors.

The Accelerator launched in 2012 to <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/2012-04-16_AcceleratorPressRelease1.pdf">widespread support</a>. There were <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/2012/11/01/meet-the-accelerator-companies/">seven startups</a> in the inaugural class, chosen from more than 235 applicants. This year, entrepreneurs and investors Ron Bouganim and Tim O'Reilly will reprise their leadership in selecting and mentoring this year's companies.

The Code for America Accelerator is looking for startups building products for governments. The application can be found online here: <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/accelerator">http://codeforamerica.org/accelerator</a>. The deadline for applications is April 30, 2013<strong>. </strong>The program will begin in August 2013.

“Code for America has helped us refine our tools, and deliver them to preparing communities. In just a few months, they’ve taken us from good-hearted idea to technology company,” said Caitria O’Neill, CEO of <a href="http://recovers.org/">Recovers</a>, one of the participating companies.
