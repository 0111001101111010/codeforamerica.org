This Saturday, Code for America will be hosting another Iconathon with the City of Boston! Held in collaboration with The Noun Project, Boston's event will focus on designing new icons for Education: schools, buses, books, pencils -- anything we can think of, anything that'll lead to useful and beautiful symbols for the public domain.

We're thrilled to have a few special guest speakers, on both the education and the design fronts, to share their knowledge and expertise:

<h3>About Iconathons</h3>

Code for America, in partnership with the <a href="http://thenounproject.org">Noun Project</a> is organizing a new initiative to create civic symbols for the public domain, at day-long design events called “Iconathons.” Through facilitated design sessions, participants will generate icons and symbols that visually convey concepts frequently needed in civic design. The aim of Iconathon is to add to the public domain a set of graphic symbols that can be used by both the public and the private sectors to easily communicate universally recognized concepts to city inhabitants.
