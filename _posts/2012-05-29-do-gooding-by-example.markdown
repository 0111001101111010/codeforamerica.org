You may not find what you’re looking for.

What you really need is probably right next door: the lessons learned from your neighbors for what works (and what doesn’t). Google searches won’t help you find those.

Imagine having a vision for a summer block party. You go online to look for information, and you're immediately blocked. Maybe you can't find the right permit. Maybe you can't figure out which city department to call.

You know block parties are possible because you've read about them <a href="http://www.sunsetblockparty.info/" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/106995976055241/" target="_blank">here</a>, and <a href="http://www.meetup.com/sf-pops/events/59542682/" target="_blank">here</a>. But you can't find the details you need to make your vision a reality. You might quit before you've even started. If you do continue, you'll repeat the same research and planning steps that many people have done before you.

Cities can do a lot to address this complexity, and some have started. San Francisco has launched <a href="http://www.sfbetterstreets.org/" target="_blank">SF Better Streets</a>, whose mission is to simplify the process for street improvements. It's a great step forward. But it doesn't capture specific how-to details from the best source of information: the people who've already completed these projects successfully.

If we want to encourage people to take an active role in improving their city, couldn't we help them find that best source of information? We might look at how this is done in areas like technology, home improvement, and interior design. Within these communities, people make public their solutions, their tools, and their mistakes. With the result that others are encouraged to learn by copying (and tweaking) their real-life examples.

The technology industry, for example, is grounded in learning by copying someone else's example. If you can't figure out why something isn't working in your application, you Google it and copy a solution to your error. Likewise if you can't figure out how to make the latest DIY handbag, you Google for a tutorial that shows you how to make it.

Fundamentally this kind of learning ecosystem is powered by a sense of common cause. When I find a solution to a problem, I make it public. Because tomorrow I'm going to need someone else's public solution to solve a different problem. In the city space, could we cultivate a similar learning ecosystem?

Meet <a href="http://www.neighborhow.org" target="_blank">Neighborhow</a>. Brought to you by Code for America and the <a href="http://www.phila.gov" target="_blank">City of Philadelphia</a>, Neighborhow will crowd-source how-tos and best practices around specific neighborhood improvement projects. Anyone—residents, groups, even city government—will be able to copy, edit, and improve upon the content. Neighborhow will also connect to resources in city government and community organizations and to tools like <a href="http://philly.changeby.us" target="_blank">Change by Us</a> and <a href="http://www.neighborgoods.net" target="_blank">NeighborGoods</a> to help people complete their projects.

We're piloting Neighborhow in Philadelphia where we'll focus on three topics related to the city's "Smarter, Safer, Greener" efforts—organizing a block cleanup, hosting a block party, and starting a neighborhood watch. Before we pilot the Neighborhow program itself, we want to learn if city residents want to participate in and contribute to this kind of learning ecosystem.

We're asking people to sign up as Writers, Editors, and Doers as a way to assess their interest. Please help us out by sharing <a href="http://www.neighborhow.org" target="_blank">Neighborhow</a> with your friends and family. We think it's valuable to many cities and for many other topics. So <a href="http://www.neighborhow.org" target="_blank">get involved</a> and help us build it!
