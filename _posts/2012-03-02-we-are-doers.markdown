<p>For a decade Government Technology has honored the years’ “Top 25 Doers, Dreamers &amp; Drivers in Public Sector Innovation.” And this year Code for America 2011 Fellows were on the list.</p>
<blockquote><p>Since 2002, we’ve dedicated the March issue of Government Technology to 25 people who cut through the public sector’s infamous barriers to innovation – tight budgets, organizational inertia, politics as usual, etc. – to reshape government operations for the better. This year, we honor an eclectic group of individuals from government, academia and the private sector who share a willingness to challenge convention and find new answers to long-standing issues. Congratulations to our 2012 Doers, Dreamers and Drivers.</p></blockquote>
<p>We’re proud of the <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/2011-fellows/" target="_blank">19 men and women</a> who led Code for America through the inaugural fellowship–and think this honor is extremely well bestowed.  Of course, we’re partial. But I encourage you to take a gander at some of the <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/projects" target="_blank">great things</a> they did last year, and decide for yourself.</p>
<p>To name a few: wrote 21 applications, opened 72 datasets, and attended 81 civic hackathons.</p>
<blockquote><p>In 2011, CfA’s 19 fellows worked for 11 months in Boston; Seattle; Washington, D.C.; and Philadelphia. These developers, designers, analysts and researchers were embedded with host cities to help them undertake innovative projects they couldn’t do on their own. The fellows were so successful in fostering innovation that there are now eight participating cities.</p>
<p>“The 2011 fellows believe in the promise that government is, at its heart, what we do together that we can’t do individually,” said CfA founder Jennifer Pahlka. “We live in an era where new tools and approaches make it possible to make this promise real, and these talented, passionate and courageous individuals brought their technical and creative skills to this important work.”</p>
