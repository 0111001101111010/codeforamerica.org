We know that cities across the country are facing serious and significant challenges, and over the past year, I’ve had the pleasure to get to talk directly with city officials from across the country to get a sense of  what exactly those challenges are. And the truth is they are facing very similar challenges and want many of the same things for their residents. And we at Code for America think that's a good thing, because that means we can develop new kinds of solutions that have greater impact.

During our February 8th webinar I’d like to share with you some of our learnings: what we’ve been hearing from local leaders across the country, why cities are interested in our program, and how our projects can change the way citizens and governments work together. We will also go over the <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/cities">2012 City Program</a> and what we're hoping to achieve with our partners. We will have a significant amount of time dedicated to Q&amp;A so please join us and ask those important questions that you and others want answered.
