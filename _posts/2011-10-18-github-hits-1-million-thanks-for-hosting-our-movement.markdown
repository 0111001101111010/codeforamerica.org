<p>Last night, <a href="http://www.github.com">Github</a> held a thank you <a href="https://github.com/blog/952-1-million-user-party-mon-oct-17-in-sf">party</a> to celebrate a huge milestone, <a href="https://github.com/blog/936-one-million">1 million users</a>. To put that in perspective, the Bureau of Labor Statistics <a href="http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos303.htm">reports</a> that the US employs around 1.3 million software developers. Even factoring in international and non-coders, they’ve got a serious percentage of the talent market.</p>
<p>Reaching 1 million users for any startup is awesome. Reaching 1 million software developers as users is a sublime network effect. For me, Github is not just a code repository. It’s a discovery system for brilliant people to find and leverage each other’s work product to innovate and hone their craft.</p>
<p>We find and follow all kinds of interesting gov 2.0 coders through forks, watching, issues and just googling ‘____  github.’ It’s a talent pool meets project management system meets science show off lab.</p>
<p>Github powers almost everything we do for code at Code for America. All of our <a href="http://www.github.com/codeforamerica">documentation</a>, projects, templates, <a href="https://github.com/codeforamerica/cfa_coder_sounds">cultural elements</a>, <a href="http://commits.codeforamerica.org">daily</a> and <a href="http://stats.codeforamerica.org">weekly stats </a>dashboard and even our <a href="https://github.com/codeforamerica/lunch_roulette">lunch dating</a> all tie in through the <a href="http://octodex.github.com/">OctoCat</a> servers.</p>
<p>Beyond CfA, nearly every open government project, app contest entry, hack weekend or other major multi-person coding effort is happening free and open through GitHub.</p>
<p>I think it’s quickly becoming an underpinning piece of infrastructure in the open government movement.</p>
<p>Github, thanks for playing a part in hosting the open government movement.</p>
<p>Our Badgers &amp; Pandas salute your OctoCats.</p>
