title: Gifting Ethics Impact on Civic Hacking

excerpt: Gifting. For me, the word brings up memories of holidays, birthdays, weddings
  and other generally happy times. With the exception of the waffle iron from a partner
  who liked waffles (and wanted me to make them!) and white elephant snafus, I'm happy
  to accept gifts. In the government world, on the other hand, gifting is a big NO-NO.
  This includes lunches, devices, air fare, even conference passes. In Boston, I offered
  to buy lunch for two others along with my colleague.It was a total of $30 extra,
  plus tips. NO! They paid for themselves to ensure that they wouldn't conflict with
  gifting ethic rules.

Gifting. For me, the word brings up memories of holidays, birthdays, weddings and other generally happy times. With the exception of the waffle iron from a partner who liked waffles (and wanted me to make them!) and white elephant snafus, I'm happy to accept gifts. In the government world, on the other hand, gifting is a big NO-NO. This includes lunches, devices, air fare, even conference passes.

I've pulled up the <a href="http://www.sanantonio.gov/ecfl/documents/GiftHandbook.htm">City of San Antonio</a> as an example:
<blockquote>In addition to the general rule, the Ethics Code has specific restrictions and limitations on gifts from three types of donors:

1) Any individual or business entity doing or seeking to do business with the City;

2) any registered lobbyist or public relations firm;

3) any person seeking or advocating on zoning or platting matters before a city body.</blockquote>
What I didn't expect is the influence of ethics rules on programming. In open source, I always ask advice or help on my applications. Another coder always knows how to do it better, faster, cheaper, etc. Sometimes this might just be advice, but often, it's an actual piece of code I pulled down at a fellow coder's prodding, which I'm free to do thanks to open source licensing and code hubs. In cities, however, IT hands are often tied. Having trouble connecting your licensing and permitting SQL database to the CRM application built by XX vendor? You can't ask your old genius college roommate to hack out a solution.Beyond the security issues of inviting an outside agent into the city IT environment, his/her code is considered a gift.

The rule makes some sense.  Competition is important to keep from cronyism or nepotism in city contracting. If your college roommate works for Google, and your city uses Google Apps for email, there might be a conflict of interest. Perhaps Microsoft will claim unfair practices if Google engineers are giving free code to city IT engineers, thus biasing them to maintain Google Apps even if the Microsoft deal is better.

Another potential conflict of interest revolves around hiring. It your college roommate applies for a job, and he's picked over other candidates, they might claim that he had unfair access to city employees (also known as nepotism, after all, you're friends). In the corporate world, we call that a refer-an-employee program, but it's a no-no in government.

Cities use <a href="http://cmsreport.com/blog/2009/using-wordpress-city-saves-19000">Wordpress</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/seattle_city">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://ko-kr.facebook.com/pages/San-Jose-CA/City-of-San-Jose/65782505449">Facebook</a>. These are free accounts, the latter being free SAAS services, and the former, a free open source software CMS. City employees can upload plugins into Wordpress or install applications on the Facebook pages. Is anyone suing city x because they didn't put out an RFP for a 140 character text sharing service? Of course not, who issues an RFP for a free service?

Can your college roommate write a wordpress plugin that pulls in your twitter feeds specifically hash-tagged? Yep! They don't need access to core city servers, citizen data or special permission from the IT boss. Your friend uploads the plugin into a public repo for others, and bam, you can download under the Wordpress license. The reason? The code is publicly uploaded and under a free license for anyone to use. In other words, the transaction is open and under the sun. Anyone can see that code, make changes to it or download and install it. The college roomie can code for an open-source product and make it publicly available, but they can't come into the office and just hack it out for you.

Wordpress and publicly available APIs provide an interesting model to think about government coding. The public and platform nature of Wordpress solves a lot of thorny issues involved in coding and the gifting policies. Unfortunately, most of the software inside government isn't under an open license. City staff can't simply upload the vendor-based software to <a href="http://www.github.com">GitHub</a>. City authored applications are a different story, like <a href="http://octo.dc.gov/DC/OCTO/">DC's OCTO Labs</a>. If licensed properly, those applications could have the same kind of development community around civic apps that sustains and innovates Wordpress, and we might be able to avoid the prickly gifting issues, while being able to tap civic minded hackers to help out. That's, at least, part of what I'm hoping we can accomplish with <a href="http://civiccommons.com">Civic Commons</a>. We need a platform where these types of transactions can happen without worry about gifting ethics rules.

Food for thought: How can we open up government systems for more open source coding that avoids the thorny issues of ethics rules surrounding gifts? Or maybe your city doesn't have this issue? If not, how does culture, rules, or policy allow it?
