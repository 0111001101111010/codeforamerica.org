<p dir="ltr">I believe the power of design to provide better services, create connections, and inspire people. I’m coding for America to apply my interaction and experience design skills to deserving cities that are in need of design and technology services to innovate and better serve their communities.</p>
<p dir="ltr">From early school projects to my professional work today, I care deeply about making information and services accessible, creating connections, and working at a variety of scales and with a wide array of media. Now through Code for America, I work in the urban environment and serve city governments and their citizens through good design and technology, and evolve what it means to be a city in the 21st century.</p>
<p>I am impressed by the work that Code for America has been doing over the last few years and am excited to be part of it while also helping to push it further both digitally and physically. I have worked on multidisciplinary teams creating print materials, mobile applications, websites, kiosks, media walls, institutions, and master planning for new communities. The lines are starting to blur between the physical and the digital and that truly excites me. Through studying how people move and interact with each other and technology in spaces, more effective applications that better serve people and places can be created. I look forward to fully exploring what a higher blend of physical and digital means for Code for America’s projects, and how that blend can continue to improve the reach and power of an amazing organization and the advancement of our cities for the Americans who live there.</p>
