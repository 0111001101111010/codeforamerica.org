<h1>ABOUT THE BRIGADE</h1>
The Code for America Brigade is an organizing force for a growing community of civic minded developers, designers, data scientists, and community leaders who will contribute their talents towards addressing the problems we see everyday. The technology that weâ€™ll develop together and deploy locally will form a new Civic Web.
<h2>Web Platform</h2>

 - A portal to connect individuals with local projects and collaborators and to stand up and maintain civic applications such as <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/?cfa_project=adopt-a-hydrant">Adopt-a-Hydrant</a> and <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/2011/11/22/explore-city-art-3-ways-on-foursquare-twitter-mobile-sites/">Art Mapper</a>.
 - Project pages for civic apps with comprehensive technical documentation and strategies for implementation.</li>

<h2>Community Engagement</h2>

 - Brigade teams use events and local area networks to increase adoption and sustainability of open source civic technology.
 - CfA develops corporate, government, and non-profit partnerships that create a pipeline of resources and opportunities for the nodes in the Brigade network.
