Over the past few months, we've sat down with both civic and industry leaders to learn more about how technology can be used to make cities work better. In our conversations with Mark Zuckerberg, Aneesh Chopra, and many others, we recognized not only a common desire for change in government, but also a sense of optimism in the <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/fellows">CfA Fellowship</a>. They believed in our cause to code government for the 21st century, and they all were eager to know, "What if...?"

Their responses inspired us, so we put this video together to share their inspiration with you:
