In November, Code for America proudly closed out its first class of <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/accelerator">Accelerator</a> startups. <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/2013startups" target="_blank">These seven</a> companies showed investors, press, and the Code for America community what was possible with technology -- and provided services that fulfilled real need among governments (literally) everywhere. Code for America profoundly believes in the need to not only build advocates and innovators within government, but also the field of lean, agile civic startups who can sell their services to government.
<h3><strong>The Code for America Incubator</strong></h3>
This January, building on the momentum of the Accelerator, and fueled by the need to further support the growing civic startup ecosystem, Code for America will be "<a href="http://codeforamerica.org/incubation/">incubating</a>" three promising startup teams.

The teams, <a href="http://www.blightstatus.com">BlightStatus</a>, <a href="http://localdata.com/">LocalData</a>, and <a href="http://www.textizen.com/welcome">Textizen</a>, were chosen from a pool of Code for America fellows interested in pursuing startups by an advisory board assembled by Tim O’Reilly and Ron Bouganim. They will participate in a six-month mentorship and support program, providing them a launching pad to viability come next June.
