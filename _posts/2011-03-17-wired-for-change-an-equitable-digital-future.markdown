<p><img alt="" class="alignleft" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5093/5452316810_110ce7dfef.jpg" title="Photo courtesy of the Ford Foundation" width="350"/>The <a href="http://www.fordfoundation.org/">Ford Foundation</a> has posted videos of sessions from last month’s <a href="http://www.fordfoundation.org/issues/freedom-of-expression/advancing-media-rights-and-access/news?id=451">Wired for Change</a> conference, featuring social innovators, technologists, entrepreneurs and philanthropists like Bill Clinton, Tim Berners-Lee, and Arianna Huffington working to answer a question close to Code for America’s heart: “How do we create an innovative and equitable digital future?”</p>
<p>Luis Ubiñas, President of the Ford Foundation, outlined the challenges and potential of technology for those on the forefront of promoting social change. “It’s abundantly clear that the use of technology for social good will not materialize spontaneously, and it is by no means a certainty. It will happen only if we make a deliberate effort to envision a role for technology in advancing social good, and then deliberately work to fulfill that vision,” he said. “We must recognize that every element of social justice—education, health, political participation, economic opportunity and more—is dependent on harnessing digital technology for social good.”</p>
<p>Many speakers highlighted the importance of reducing the digital divide to ensure social equality as the Internet becomes an increasingly central part of civic life: “There are different kinds of networks. The water network, the electricity network… those are essential inputs for society that everyone needs in order to flourish. [The] same thing [is happening now] with high speed internet access,” said Susan Crawford of Cardozo Law School.</p>
<p>Promoting equal access to broadband should be a priority for individuals and organizations working to advance social good, said Anthony Romero, Executive Director of the American Civil Liberties Union: “[The net] has got to be equally seen as a part of our community and democracy’s infrastructure that [must] be accessible to all people on the same terms, just like we understand highways and roads and telephone lines.”</p>
<p>In his <a href="http://www.fordfoundation.org/issues/freedom-of-expression/advancing-media-rights-and-access/news?id=452">closing remarks</a>, Luis Ubiñas urged innovators, philanthropists, and entrepreneurs to maximize the new opportunities for growth presented by new technology and guarantee their benefits for everyone, especially marginalized groups: “Digital access is an essential element of full participation in modern society… We cannot therefore treat technology—which today offers the greatest means for participation that we’ve ever experienced—as a scarce resource available only to some.”</p>
