<p><strong><em>Our virtual rendition of the proverbial water cooler. </em></strong></p>
<p>In the Code for America offices, we have dozens of passionate people spending their days working to make government better through technology; let’s be clear, this is hard work. But that doesn’t mean it has to be boring. In fact, everyone makes sure of that. Links to interesting articles, videos, or projects circle through the office at such speed and frequency that we had to create a separate email thread just to handle the load. </p>
<p>The following is a handpicked collection of the best news, successes, and distractions that represent our collective inbox and culture. This is our Fuzz. (And yeah, that’s what we named the email alias.)</p>
<p><a href="http://senseable.mit.edu/csa/visuals.html" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-7690" height="150" src="http://codeforamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Picture-102-150x150.png" title="Picture 10" width="150"/></a>Researchers at <a href="http://senseable.mit.edu/">MIT’s SENSEable City Lab</a> analyzed cellphone traffic from AT&amp;T and IBM to construct a map visualizing the patterns in our <a href="http://senseable.mit.edu/csa/visuals.html" target="_blank">“Connected States of America”</a>.  They found that cities play an important role in defining community boundaries. They act as connective hubs as people move to them from nearby counties and from far across the country. Basically, this map offers a far more nuanced understanding of what we already knew: Americans are more connected to each other than ever before.</p>

First, Gotham’s Mayor hosted<a href="http://reinventnycgov.com/"> Reinvent NYC.Gov</a>, a contest to fully re-design NYC’s Web presence. Then, we cheered on Bloomberg as he took a stand against wasteful government IT procurement and <a href="http://www.itworld.com/software/179037/nyc-mayor-demands-600m-refund-software-project">d</a><a href="http://www.itworld.com/software/179037/nyc-mayor-demands-600m-refund-software-project">emanded a $600 million refund </a>for a troubled software project. Of course this is all on top of our heartfelt appreciation to the Mayor for luring the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/31/nyregion/new-yorks-chief-digital-officer-seeks-to-connect-the-city-and-the-public.html">talented Rachel Sterne</a> onto Team Gov.</p>

It runs on Iriz, Linux, BSD, Windows, Mac OS X, and is one of the most popular  games ever on Silicon Graphics machines. The nostalgia made it harder than ever to resist the temptation for impromptu office LAN parties. Warning: The game is wildly addictive and intern productivity slowed to snail’s pace for the better of a week.</p>
<p>Yes. We are st<a href="http://www.tnr.com/print/article/books/magazine/91916/google-schmidt-obama-gates-technocrats" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-7675" height="150" src="http://codeforamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Picture-3-150x150.png" title="Picture 3" width="150"/></a>ill mulling the benefits and consequences of Google’s meteoric rise. This <a href="http://www.tnr.com/print/article/books/magazine/91916/google-schmidt-obama-gates-technocrats" target="_blank">particularly good piece in the New Republic</a> considers two new books with two opposing propositions:  (1) <em>If only we could bring ourselves to trust Google its bright young engineers would deliver us the revolutionary services that we could never expect from our governments</em> VS.  (2) <em>Google is so new, sly, and fluid, and the threats that it poses to society are so invisible, insidious, and monumental, that regulators may not yet have the proper analytical models to understand its true market and cultural power.</em> Discuss.</p>

Tim can sing, beat box, play guitar, do harmony, and swoon simultaneously.  He showed us his talents last week when he shared his <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsNuw6M2X8I">acoustic mash up of Rebecca Black’s “Friday”</a>. At CfA we support creativity in and out of our Terminals. Congratulations, Tim, on earning the FUZZ award for Most Personal Flare.</p>

So go! Contribute your ideas to develop relevant symbols for objects like ‘potholes’ and ‘grafitti’ or civic ideas like ‘local’ or ‘community news’. All skill levels welcome.</p>

But, we also think spreadsheets are boring. Infographics are a tool to bridge the gap. Infographics can turn data into compelling stories which can help the most tech averse among us quickly grasp complex relationships and ideas. <a href="http://visual.ly/">Visual.ly</a> collects some of the best examples on the web.
