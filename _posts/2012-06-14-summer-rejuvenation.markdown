<p>The interns have arrived.</p>
<p>They’re full of energy and enthusiasm - and great ideas. During their first week we told them all about Code for America, and they told us about their adventures making their way out to San Francisco.</p>
<p>It seems they’ve arrived at the perfect time to infuse some energy into the office. Summer’s beginning and we’re about half way through the fellowship — needless to say, fresh perspectives and new faces are a great way to rejuvenate the fellows and the staff for a summer chock-full of apps to build, campaigns to run, blogs to write, events to host — the list goes on, and on, and on.</p>
<p>They’ll be here until August 10, so stay tuned – they’ll be up to some very interesting things.</p>
<p><strong>Welcome Rob, Joey, Stephen, Hannah, Anne, Michelle, Ariel, Phillip, Matt, and Sam.</strong> <strong>We’re glad you’re here.</strong></p>
