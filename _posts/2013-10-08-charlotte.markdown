<h4>The Community</h4>
The largest City in North Carolina, Charlotte is the second largest banking center in the US with ten Fortune 500 companies calling the city home. The city is also host to tech giants like LendingTree, an ecosystem of startup groups like Packard Place, Queen City Forward and RevTech Labs and rich academic institutions like UNC Charlotte College of Computing &amp; Informatics.

As the city moves into its 2014 fellowship year, we aim to support Charlotte’s efforts in citizen engagement and greater government transparency.
