We caught this sweet post on Code for Pittsburgh forum. It's local government inviting the brigade to start a dialog with the city about open data. Sounds like a good topic for some Brigade meetups or maybe a <a title="home page" href="http://citycamp.govfresh.com">CityCamp</a>.

Code for America is partnered with <a title="home page" href="http://wagner.nyu.edu">NYU Wagner Graduate School of Public Service</a> and others to develop technical challenges richly informed by NYC gov and not-for-profits through a competition called Code for Change. The competition was recently opened to technologists to form teams and win challenges.
