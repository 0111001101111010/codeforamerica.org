We're thrilled to be based out of the SoMA area of San Francisco, a hotbed for tech startups (where keeping tabs on new companies is as easy as searching for a new wireless network). Almost everyday, it seems, there's a new company with a new product and a new possibility for impact. And this is just in one part of the city.

This summer, we're going to be working with our friends at <a href="http://gaffta.org">Gray Area Foundation for the Arts</a> (GAFFTA) to take advantage of that energy and talent with a new initiative to develop innovative solutions to pressing urban issues for San Francisco. The program, called <em><a href="http://summerofsmart.org">Summer of Smart</a></em>, will directly engage SF’s innovation, urbanism, and social change communities through a series of events throughout the summer, kicking off this Thursday, June 16th, with <a href="http://sf.govfresh.com/sfopen2011/">SFOpen11</a>, a debate on technology and open government between nine mayoral candidates presented with <a href="http://govfresh.com">GovFresh</a> and <a href="http://change.org">Change.org</a>. This will be followed by the second annual <a href="http://citycampsf.org">CityCampSF</a> unconference just two days later on June 18.

And that's just the start. Summer of Smart consists of three components:

<ul>

	<li><strong>A series of Urban Challenge Weekends</strong> – 48-hour hack-a-thons where application prototypes are developed in key urban focus areas; accompanied by keynote speakers and cocktail discussion mixers</li>

	<li><strong>A series of public events</strong> – debates, forums, presentations, and (un)conferences – around the issues of open data, open government, technology, and innovation</li>

	<li><strong>An online portal</strong> of all the applications and media coverage associated with the Summer, hosted and curated by GAFFTA and The Bay Citizen.</li>

</ul>

So there's a lot going on, and we're excited to be a part of it. We're hoping to contribute to the ideas, technology, and connections made at events, and try to spread them nationally to maximize their impact.



But first things first: <a href="http://cocktails-candidates-code.eventbrite.com/">a cocktail party</a>. While the debate this week has limited seating -- there will be livestreaming though! -- as soon as it ends, we'll open up the space at the Automattic / Wordpress offices for cocktails, mixing, and discussion of the debate and all the exciting issues involved. We hope you'll join us: <a href="http://cocktails-candidates-code.eventbrite.com/">http://cocktails-candidates-code.eventbrite.com/</a>
