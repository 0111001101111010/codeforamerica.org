In 2011, our inaugural class of <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/fellows">fellows</a> took a huge leap of faith in joining us. No one knew if the program would work, or if employers would want to hire fellows after their year of service. Now, with two classes under our belts and a third half way through their fellowship, we can announce a verdict: Code for America fellowship alumni are in huge demand — as employees and entrepreneurs.

Some alumni have continued to work in the civic space, in public service in the <a title="NUM Boston" href="http://www.newurbanmechanics.org/boston/">Boston Mayor’s Office of New Urban Mechanics</a> and the <a title="Oakland PEC" href="http://www2.oaklandnet.com/Government/o/CityAdministration/d/PublicEthics/index.htm">Oakland Public Ethics Commission</a>, and as part of companies like <a title="OpenPlans" href="http://openplans.org">OpenPlans</a>, <a title="Granicus" href="http://www.granicus.com">Granicus</a>, and <a title="ReBoot" href="http://thereboot.org">Reboot</a>.

A number of fellows have founded civic startups — <a title="ElectNext" href="http://electnext.com">ElectNext</a>, <a href="http://opencounter.us/">OpenCounter</a>, <a href="http://civicinsight.com/">Civic Insight</a>, <a href="http://localdata.com/">LocalData</a>, and <a title="Textizen" href="http://www.textizen.com">Textizen</a>. OpenCounter, Civic Insight, LocalData, and Textizen all won substantial Knight Foundation funding this year. Textizen, LocalData, and Civic Insight stayed on at CfA as part of the Incubator program to help kickstart their startups (thanks to Google for Entrepreneurs). The fellows who started Iconathon created <a href="http://thenounproject.com/collections/iconathon/" target="_blank">a movement</a> of new symbol creation.

And many more fellows are now employed as architects, developers, product managers, designers, developer evangelists, and more at some of the most prominent companies in technology — <a title="Airbnb" href="http://airbnb.com">Airbnb</a>, <a title="Trulia" href="http://trulia.com">Trulia</a>, <a title="Upworthy" href="http://www.upworthy.com">Upworthy</a>, <a href="http://www.soundcloud.com">SoundCloud</a>, <a title="Exec" href="http://www.exec.com">Exec</a>, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/facebook">Facebook</a>, <a title="Twilio" href="http://www.twilio.com/">Twilio</a>, <a title="OKCupid Labs" href="http://www.okcupidlabs.com/">OKCupid Labs</a>, <a title="Pivotal" href="http://pivotallabs.com">Pivotal Labs</a>, <a title="Google" href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/about/">Google</a>, and <a title="GitHub" href="http://github.com">GitHub</a> can all boast former CfA fellows on their staff.

We talk a lot about what our fellows achieve during their year with us (we’re just a little bit proud) and we thought you’d like to know what happens after as well.

<strong>To apply for the fellowship visit <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/apply">codeforamerica.org/apply</a> before July 31.</strong>
