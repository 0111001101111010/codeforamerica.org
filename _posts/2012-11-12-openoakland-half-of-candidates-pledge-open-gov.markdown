<p>As Oakland’s election results are locked in we’re looking at the start of a very new era for Oakland politics. Six major seats were open for competition this year: one at-large council seat, four district council seats, and the position of city attorney. Now that the results are in, we are calling this election a success for open government: 15 of the 27 candidates competing signed on to an <a href="http://http://oaklandcandidates.org/" target="_blank" title="Open Government Pledge">open government pledge</a>! Of the six winning candidates, four signed the pledge.</p>
<p>The campaign season afforded the opportunity to get the concept of open government out in front of everyone running for office — and all current elected officials. The response from many candidates was overwhelmingly positive and this is encouraging for our future efforts.  Some candidates did not quite understand who we were, which is understandable given how new we are as an organization.</p>
<p>While not conducted as a political exercise, an accountability campaign, or a campaign looking to receive funding, this effort is important in Oakland. One of the biggest outcomes is the increased awareness and education of local government officials and staff on the issues of open government, open data, and modern engagement methods. We saw it as a valuable role  for us to positively support our civic leaders in developing and implementing a new vision for government in the 21st century- essentially Government 2.0.</p>
<p>Our governments have been isolated from broader communities for too long which breeds insular activities and planning.  What we’re trying to encourage is a redefinition of what citizenship is through increased participation in civic issues, and to reshape how government plans, act and engage.  We hope this open government campaign (and our following efforts like  <a href="http://citycampoak.org/" target="_blank">CityCamp in Oakland</a> in December) start to break down some of the false barriers between our community and our government.</p>
<p>The candidates who were elected and who signed the pledge are: Dan Kalb (District 1), Lynette Gibson-McElhaney (District 3), Noel Gallo (District 5) and Barbara Parker (City Attorney).  The two other winners in this election were Rebecca Kaplan and Larry Reid, both of whom never responded to this campaign.</p>
