<p>Earlier this month, on the fourth of July, Code for America launched the <a href="http://openimpact.us/">Open Impact campaign</a> to redefine citizenship and educate people about the benefits of open government. In our first of a four part series, we’ll be highlighting steps in our citizen toolkit to help you further the mission of Open Impact in your community.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>“All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.”</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;">                                                                               -Edmund Burke</p>
<p>Edmund Burke lived out his days without the internet, text messaging, or video chat. Today, however, we live in a world defined by accessible communication and collaboration.</p>
<p>Never before has it been so simple for an opinion to be shared, an image to be sent, or an idea built upon. We’re calling on you to use the power of today’s technology to spread the word about open government.</p>
<p>Take the two steps below to spread the message of open government to your community – fellow citizens and government leaders. We estimate that both steps will take just seven minutes. Remember, small actions build into great movements.</p>
<p>Don’t let Edmund Burke down!</p>
<p><strong>Spread the word!</strong></p>
