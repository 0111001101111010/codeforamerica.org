title: 'Our Own Little Laboratory of Democracy: An Open Cities ThinkUp'
author: Abhi Nemani

excerpt: Local governments are considered "laboratories of democracy" -- the places
  where ideas are generated, tried, and evaluated. Instead of relying on just the
  one, decidedly cumbersome national government to generate new policy, the founders
  crafted a flexible federal structure, where the more numerous and more nimble states
  and cities could experiment on their own and see what works. Simply put, no institution
  would have a monopoly on good ideas. The best ideas from any government would bubble
  up and benefit every government. But only if those ideas are shared. That's why
  today, with so many cities and states across the country <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2009/11/19/open-government-laboratories-democracy">currently
  experimenting with open government</a>, today we're <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/opencities-thinkup">launching
  our own experiment</a>, and, in true democratic fashion, we need your help.

In partnership with <a href="http://expertlabs.org">Expert Labs</a> and <a href="http://americancity.org/"><em>Next American City</em></a>, we are working to generate a playbook for Open Cities -- a sense of what works and what doesn't. We are looking for success stories, initiatives, or opportunities for local governments to become more transparent, participatory, efficient, and inclusive. And we're not just interested in the newest iPhone apps or websites; we want to know how cities are leveraging new tools to help the poorest and most vulnerable members of society as well -- a topic, we feel, that is often lost in Gov 2.0 discussions. This inventory will not only help us expand our own understanding, but also develop the general awareness of how cities are becoming more open.

Thanks to the help of our friends at <a href="http://expertlabs.org">Expert Labs</a>, you'll be able to track and respond to all the questions and responses <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/opencities-thinkup">on our site</a> as well. Anil Dash and Gina Trapani have led the development of a great open source social media analytics tool called <a href="http://thinkupapp.com">ThinkUp</a>, which allows users to track responses to questions posted on social networks. It's a useful way to control some of the chaos of crowdsourcing. It will help us aggregate all of your ideas and (since we like to practice what we preach) share them openly with you here: <strong><a href="http://codeforamerica.org/opencities-thinkup">http://codeforamerica.org/opencities-thinkup</a></strong>

This is an experiment -- we've never tried something like this before -- so we'll not only evaluate our findings but also our approach at the end of the project. <em>Next American City</em> is helping us to do just that. In early November, they are hosting a conference focused on these important issues, aptly titled, <a href="http://americancity.org/opencities2010/">Open Cities: New Media's Role in Shaping Urban Policy</a>, in partnership with the Rockefeller Foundation. The conference will explore "new media's strategies for dealing with a variety of challenges, such as how to build an engaged urban citizenry, best utilize municipal data and develop cost-saving technologies or networks to improve cities." We're excited to partner with <em>Next American City</em> to help us share our findings at the conference and online.

So tell us, how technology is making a difference in your city, or any city. Point us to new ideas, where they're happening, and the people and organizations behind them. With any contribution, you'll be making our little democratic experiment a success, and more importantly, you'll be making our common and urgent goal of more open cities a success as well.<!-- http://twitter.com/CodeforAmerica/status/26432889934 -->
