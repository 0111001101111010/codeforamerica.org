<p>There is an incredible potential hidden in the middle of things. Within our fellowship cohort, the middle of the year is constantly stirring with possibilities, chaos, triumph, and the potential for greatness, even before the fellows’ culminating presentations at our annual CfA Summit.</p>
<p>Today, I thought I’d share some on the goings on in Kansas City (both them actually).</p>
<p>Some of you may be familiar with the work <a href="https://fiber.google.com/about/" target="_blank">Google Fiber</a> in Kansas City — and we’ve had the privilege of partnering with Kansas City this year, which has led to some incredible collaborations.</p>
<p>Firs off, CfA Fellows, Andrew Hyder, of Team Kansas City, participated and won a “<a href="http://edckc.com/hacking-the-gigabit-city-weekend-wrap-up/" target="_blank">Hacking the Gigabit City</a>” hackathon with his hackathon team.</p>
<p>More broadly, Andrew and his Kansas City teammate Ariel Kennan have been building an application and a community around effective online business training (and I can’t wait to share it with all of you).</p>
<p>Their work was recently featured in an <a href="http://www.npr.org/2013/05/28/186861864/how-apps-help-kansas-city-work-better" target="_blank">NPR story</a> which provided the broader public with an informative summary of the Code for America story, and showcased the team’s efforts at user-centered research and design.</p>
<p>This is just a taste of the strides some our fellows have made in their work, which spans both local efforts and applications with the potential to scale across multiple municipalities. The best is, assuredly, yet to come.</p>
<p>Are you ready to Code for America? <strong><a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/apply" target="_blank">Apply</a></strong> for the fellowship by July 31.</p>
