<p>In our last webinar, we heard from three fellow teams about the projects they’ve been building with their cities this year:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://codeforamerica.org/?cfa_project=blightstatus">BlightStatus</a> (built for New Orleans)</li>
<li><a href="http://codeforamerica.org/?cfa_project=honolulu-answers">Honolulu Answers</a> (built for Honolulu)</li>
<li><a href="http://codeforamerica.org/?cfa_project=311-labs">311 Labs</a> (built for Chicago)</li>
</ul>
<p>With the Fellowship drawing to a close in just a few weeks, many of these teams are busy polishing up their projects, continuing to spread the word in their communities about it, and discussing sustainability options with their cities. It’s the end of the Fellowship development process, but the beginning of the ongoing impact that these apps will have — both in the communities they were built for and in other cities across the country that reuse these tools.</p>
<p>The Fellowship reflects our awareness that building and launching a product is just the first step. Creating meaningful, significant civic engagement through technology requires both <strong>adoption</strong> of that technology by members of the community and a plan for long-term <strong>sustainability</strong> of the project.</p>
<p>That’s the idea behind our new initiative: the <a href="http://brigade.codeforamerica.org/pages/race-for-reuse">Race for Reuse</a>. We want to take the app contest beyond the typical end goal of prototyping a new app. We want to see you launch, engage, and sustain tools for your community — and we’ve designed this contest with milestones (and prizes!) to help you do it.</p>
<p>Here’s how it will work:</p>
<ul>
<li>Launch one of four featured apps in your city, and earn an advertising budget to promote.</li>
<li>Reach your target for adoption, and earn a year of free hosting to sustain the civic engagement tool you’ve deployed.</li>
<li>Achieve these milestones by Thanksgiving Day, and we’ll throw you a party in your city to celebrate.</li>
</ul>
<p>Head on over to the <a href="http://brigade.codeforamerica.org/pages/race-for-reuse">Brigade</a> to find out more and sign up now. There’s options for everyone to get involved, whether you’re a coder or not.</p>
