Code for America has had to pleasure of working closely with John this year during our partnership with the City.</p>
<p>We ask John how Chicago got to being at the forefront of open government and how others cities can follow suit.</p>
<p>“There is no reason city government can’t operate on the same principles of our hot digital sector.”</p>
<p>For John, Code for America represents “the agility, forward-thinkingness, and youth” that cities should be eager to learn from.</p>
<p>Tune-in for an exciting first-glance at how Chicago is beginning to take its cues from the digital start-up scene, and taking real steps towards innovation.</p>
