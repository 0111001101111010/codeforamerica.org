<p>At our July Salon, CfA hosted Hanauer and Liu for a discussion of their recent book, “Gardens of the Democracy.” In it, they challenge Americans to approach the world not as a machinery that needs to be perfected but as a garden that needs constant attention, discretion, and periodic weeding. The book argues that since society and technology have fundamentally changed, so must our notions of citizenship and democracy: turning “the machine” into a garden.</p>
<p>As the election season reaches a fever pitch, Nick Hanauer and Eric Liu don’t want you to blame Republicans or Democrats for the countries most intractable problems. Hanauer, a successful web entrepreneur, and Liu, a former White House speechwriter, want you to rewrite the metaphor.</p>
<p>Jennifer Pahlka, CfA’s Founder, introduced the two authors, saying, “We work to make government more efficient and certainly more transparent, but [this book] started to put that work in a bigger context. Not just a better machine, but fundamentally changing our relationship to government. We are the gardeners.”</p>
