Emily Wright is an experience and interaction designer focused on usability and information visualization. As a 2012 Code for America Fellow, Emily partnered with the City of Austin. Working across departments and city groups, her team hosted a few awesome hackathons and got to work on some really useful and important projects, like these:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.prepared.ly/" target="_blank">Prepared.ly</a> a project to help residents of Austin prepare for and assess the risk of natural disasters</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.atxfloods.com/" target="_blank">ATXfloods</a> A site to show open and closed roads during flash floods</li>
	<li><a href="http://codeforamerica.github.com/jfdicitizen/" target="_blank">JFDIcitizen</a> swearingly lovely citizen engagement</li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/emilyville/Posters" target="_blank">Open Data Circle of Awesomeness</a> graphic to explain benefits of open data</li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/emilyville/Posters" target="_blank">Should I Go To A CfA Hackathon?</a> a chart to help explain who should be attending civic hackathons</li>
	<li>and <a href="http://us4.campaign-archive2.com/home/?u=7eae25b3fcdc6e862a1a20456&amp;id=5fa034319d" target="_blank">more...</a></li>
</ul>
Although, the highlight of her year was when they put her and Prashant's <a href="http://www.emilyville.com/images/Twiliocon-DOER.jpeg" target="_blank">photo on a billboard</a> at TwilioCon. (Well, almost a billboard.)

Before becoming a Code for America Fellow, she worked as a freelance designer for several Bay Area groups including Banned by the Bay, Red Ink Studios, Intersection for the Arts, Visual Ink, and Babeland. Check out more of her work, here:
