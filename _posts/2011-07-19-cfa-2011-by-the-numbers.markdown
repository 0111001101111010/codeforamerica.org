<p>The past seven months have moved quickly at Code for America. We’ve been finding and building solutions for cities. We’ve been hosting and attending weekend-long hackathons. We’ve been eating jelly beans. We’ve been getting married. We’ve been busy.</p>
<p>Karla Macedo took a timeout to <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/?attachment_id=7534">crunch some numbers last month and create a poster</a> — a bird’s-eye-view of how far we’ve come since January, 2011. </p>
<p>Karla is talented. She has an eye for detail and a strong sense of visual storytelling. Her poster told the story of Code for America: our coding, our mission, our quirks — all of these things were captured in one image. Inspired by the poster, I got to work a few weeks ago in Final Cut Pro to animate it:</p>
