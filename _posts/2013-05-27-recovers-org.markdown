Recovers.org is a toolkit for community powered disaster recovery. The disaster response platform at [townname].recovers.org incorporates searchable databases, social media aggregation, and mobile tools, allowing grassroots organizers to efficiently marshal resources in their area. It can launch a site for an affected area in minutes, or set up an area with preparedness software and training. This allows an area to turn the wave of interest into a database of usable resources, even if their internet is knocked out for a week.
