<p dir="ltr">Two months ago, Code for America decided to launch Code for All, an international network of civic technologists working with government to improve service delivery and citizen engagement. Our goal is to build on our successful government innovation model that has worked in America and establish new global models that can help other nation’s governments as well.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We’re pleased to announce that our first expansion partner will be North Korea. As recent visits by U.S. diplomatic envoys Dennis Rodman and Eric Schmidt have shown, North Korea is ripe for disruption. Under the country’s new young leadership of Kim Jong-un, we are hopeful that web 2.0 technology can flourish and help create a culture of lean, agile, and user-centered service delivery.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Potential projects the Code for DPRK fellows might work on are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating sophisticated and elegant maps to make target planning more efficient</li>
<li>Upgrades to mobile telephony infrastructure to replace the analog hotline to the South.</li>
<li>A crowdsourced, gamified DMZ app to engage citizens in border protection</li>
</ul>
<p>We’re happy to have North Korea as our first partner in this groundbreaking endeavor.</p>
<p>We will announce new partners in the coming months. If you have any questions or want to learn more about becoming a Code for DPRK fellow, please contact jokes@codeforamerica.org.</p>
