<p>We just wrapped up the first-ever Code for America Summit. The event brought together government officials, civic developers, and foundation partners to articulate our shared vision of government made more open and effective with the help of technology.</p>
<p>Code for America – at its core – is about what can happen when local government and cutting edge technology collide. As the first people to join our “peace corp for geeks”, the 2011 Code for America fellows have more first hand experience of this reaction than anyone else.</p>
<p>We put together this short video to share the stories of our 2011 fellows. We screened it to reflect on the accomplishments of the 2011 class and to orient both our 2012 city partners and fellows to the culture we’ve created that now defines us. While there is no true way to capture it, we hope you enjoy this attempt.</p>
