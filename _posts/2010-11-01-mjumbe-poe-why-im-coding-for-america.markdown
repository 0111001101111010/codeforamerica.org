<p>For me, CfA represents an opportunity to do two things:</p>
<p><strong>1. Engage in a conversation about how government can better interact with citizens.</strong></p>
<p>This is an important conversation to have in the present time. We humans have developed some amazing tools over the last 6 or 7 decades, that over the last 10 or 15 years have changed the way we communicate with each other. People have been carrying out organizational feats — overnight million-dollar text message fundraisers, huge SMS- and Twitter-facilitated political statements, etc — that would have been impossible in a world of slow, centralized information. As a result, there is a significant amount of hype around Internet technology as the great force which gives voice to the voiceless and agency to the impotent. However, while the medium may allow for social innovation, prevailing societal power relations remain resistant. As danah boyd put it, “The Internet is not AUTOMATICALLY a great democratizer.”</p>
<p>I don’t believe that the Internet can automatically fix government either. The reality is that, even if governments and citizens start using the Internet to interact, everything will be status quo if the values remain the same. In order for the Internet to be able to make government better, we have to change. The good news is that we, as a world, are changing. The Internet, in part, is catalyzing our change. However, much like a child growing up, it’s up to us to discover and define what the changes mean, and how we will respond to them. We have to critically ask how these changes help us reframe the government-citizen relationship.</p>
<p>Today, we may have the opportunity to reframe the relationship on a wider scale than has been possible before. I think CfA understands that, and has positioned itself to help make that statement. I believe that CfA is a good place to engage others and be engaged by others who are looking to take on our changes head-on. That’s something that I want to be around to help. It’s something that I want to continue with for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p><strong>2. Learn by doing.</strong></p>
<p>For me to participate as I’d like in the conversation about how we as humans can capitalize on the changes brought on by the Internet, I realize that I have a lot to learn. Luckily, I enjoy learning, and I’m a hands-on learner. I believe that the work that I will do as a CfA fellow would be valuable. But also valuable will be the experience I and the other fellows gain that we would be able to then share with others. I believe that CfA could be an incubator for a particularly inefectious meme, and I’m glad to be a part of that.</p>
<p>Eventually I’d like to take this show on the road, working on information technology projects that directly affect people around the world, particularly in Africa, the Caribbean, and South America. I have a lot to learn to be successful in that as well, but I believe lessons learned as a CfA fellow, working with government on on projects, will serve me well.</p>
