On Sunday, Joel Mahoney and Talin Salway competed and won in the <a href="https://company.podio.com/hackday/">Work 2.0</a> challenge hosted by API teams from <a href="http://cotweet.com/">Cotweet</a>, <a href="http://yammer.com">Yammer</a>, <a href="http://www.podio.com">Podio</a>, Jexy, <a href="http://www.cohuman.com">Cohuman</a>, and <a href="http://www.mashery.com">Mashery</a>.

Their concept HubBuds is a mashup of the <a href="http://www.github.com">Github</a> and <a href="http://www.yammer.com">Yammer</a> APIs. Â It pushes git commits to Yammer and pulls Yammer commentary back in, which allows technical and non-technical team members to stay up-to-date on shared projects.  It also translates project activity and likes/dislikes into badges and awards, which helps to maintain team spirit and velocity.  In so doing, HubBuds takes Github's concept of "social coding" a level up.

Congr<a href="https://github.com/codeforamerica/hubbuds">ats to Talin and Joel. HubBuds won them a trip to Denmark!
