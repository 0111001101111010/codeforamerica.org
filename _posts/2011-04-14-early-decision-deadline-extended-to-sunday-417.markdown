<p>We’ve been thrilled with the response to our 2012 fellowship program. Over a hundred people from different backgrounds and with different have stepped up to code for their country. It’s especially been great to see a number of college students apply to start their post-grad career with CfA. We realize, however, that in college, some tend to wait til the last minute to finish an assignment. Not naming any names. With that in mind, though, we’ve decided to push the <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/fellows/apply"><strong>deadline for the Early Application cycle to Sunday, April 17, at 9pm PT/midnight ET.</strong></a> If you apply by then, you’ll be able to receive notification of acceptance by May 1. So you’ve got the weekend now to, well, <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/fellows/apply">procrastinate</a>.</p>
<p>In the meantime, here’s a glimpse at the current applicant pool, a visualization of their responses to the questions, “Why do you want to Code for America?”</p>
