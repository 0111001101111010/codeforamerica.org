<p>At our first-ever Fellowship Projects webinar, three of our 2012 fellows shared an in-depth look at projects they’ve been building this year and had a chance to answer live questions from our audience: <a href="http://www.textizen.com/welcome">Textizen</a>, <a href="http://opencounter.org/santacruz/">OpenCounter</a>, and <a href="http://golocaldata.com/">LocalData</a>. Watch the full recording below to find out the answers to audience questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>How did Textizen, built for Philadelphia, get redeployed in Salt Lake City and the City of Boston? <strong><a href="https://vimeo.com/48826141#t=1035">(17:08)</a></strong></li>
<li>How did Ruthie, a fellow on team Santa Cruz, Calif., decide to focus on business permitting for her project, and what has it been like working with the Planning Department? <strong><a href="https://vimeo.com/48826141#t=1897">(31:33)</a></strong></li>
<li>How hard is it to redeploy LocalData? Can a non-technical community organizer do it? <strong><a href="https://vimeo.com/48826141#t=2501">(41:40)</a></strong></li>
<li>How can someone in Albuquerque, N.M. — or anyone, anywhere — bring Code for America projects to their city? <strong><a href="https://vimeo.com/48826141#t=3050">(50:48)</a></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>We’ll be livestreaming Part II of our Fellowship Projects webinar series, featuring three more apps from this year’s fellowship, at 10 a.m. Pacific (1 p.m. Eastern) on September 18, 2012: <a href="http://cfa2012webinar.eventbrite.com">RSVP now</a>.</p>
