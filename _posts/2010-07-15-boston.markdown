<h4>The Brigade</h4>
Boston has been a techie city for a very long time. The city established the nation's first <a href="http://www.cityofboston.gov/newurbanmechanics">Mayor’s Office of New Urban Mechanics</a> (MONUM) and the department’s co-chairs were named Governing Magazine’s <a href="http://www.governing.com/poy/nigel-jacob-chris-osgood.html">Public Officials of the Year</a>. With forward-thinking leaders at the helm, Boston is paving the way for civic innovation. The city has an active Code for America Brigade -- a group of local volunteers who meet regularly to attend events, collaborate on new projects and stand up existing apps.

<h4>The 2012 Fellowship in Boston</h4>
In 2011, The City of Boston applied for the fellowship program with Microsoft as their community partners. Given a strong Office of New Urban Mechanics, the <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/2011-fellows/">2011 fellows</a> Joel Mahoney, Karla Macedo and Talin Salway knew they were dealing with powerful allies. That being said, when the city requested “backpack apps” (an education API and developer platform) -- they received so much more.

Apps created during that fellowship year help <a href="http://classtalk.org/welcome, http://codeforamerica.org/?cfa_project=classtalk">teachers send students text reminders</a>, <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/?cfa_app=where%E2%80%99s-my-school-bus">help parents track the school bus in realtime</a> and <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/?cfa_app=discover-bps">help students and parents assess their school eligibility</a>.

The <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/?cfa_app=discover-bps">DiscoverBPS</a> app has been heralded by the <a href="http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2011-12-18/national/35287071_1_code-cities-private-sector&quot;">Washington Post</a> as a true feat. Fellows built the still popular application in only 2 months with the bulk of the work falling on the shoulders of developer Joel Mahoney. The app has since been taken over by the City of Boston's IT department.

Just two years later, half the parents in Boston are using this platform to identify the right school for their child. Seven percent of visitors are viewing the site in a language other than English.

Some of the other apps built that year include a <a href="http://commons.codeforamerica.org/apps/data-works">developer collaboration platform</a>, <a href="http://commons.codeforamerica.org/apps/datacouch">tool that turns spreadsheets into APIs</a>, mobile app that locates <a href="http://commons.codeforamerica.org/apps/techno-finder">wifi points</a> and a tool that looks a bit like Foursquare for snow-covered fire hydrants called <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/?cfa_app=adopt-a-hydrant-2">Adopt-a-hydrant</a>.  While "Adopt-a" may seem specific to Boston, it's since been redeployed to storm drains in Seattle and tsunami sirens in Honolulu.

<h4>Code for America: An elegant solution for government IT problems - <a href="http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2011-12-18/national/35287071_1_code-cities-private-sector&amp;quot">Washington Post</a></h4>
Parents in Boston complained bitterly about the needlessly complex enrollment process for public schools. To sign up their children for school, parents were forced to navigate a Byzantine 28-page pamphlet seemingly designed to confuse.

On a Friday in the middle of February, Michael Hughes, director of the Boston Public Schools Transportation Department, met with seven visiting fellows from Code for America, a new nonprofit organization that matches teams of young technologists with city governments for 11 months at a time.
