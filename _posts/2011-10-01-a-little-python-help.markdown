We've been sprinting hard at CfA on a project in partnership with Local Projects, CEOs for Cities, and the Knight Foundation called <a href="http://changeby.us">Change By Us</a>. It helps people generate ideas about how to improve their community, pairs similar ideas and then provides a platform for them to launch a public facing project page.

As part of the partnership, we're bringing development resources to the table to help open source and add new features to the application. We've sketched out an exciting new set of features, and we're looking to expand the team to help us make them a reality.

We're looking for one consultant with experience in python and one in javascript to help us sprint to the finish line.  You'll work with our current set of fellows to finish out the feature set and stay on through December to wrap up any remaining bugs or issues. We pay by the hour and hope to find two engineers that share our passion, values AND can work with us financially in the context of being a nonprofit.

You'll need to be more than a django, pylons or jquery-casual programmer... we need someone with hardcore, all around python-ness with an opinionated testing philosophy.  Also, if you've got some javascript chops, we'll love you even more.

You can start tomorrow and we'd love to host you in our SF offices. For details, email dan@codeforamerica.org.
