excerpt: "In just a few weeks, our inaugural class of fellows will be coming together
  in San Francisco for the first time. These are folks from all kinds of different
  backgrounds and strengths, who will be spending a year putting their heads together
  to find creative solutions to civic problems. This is an exciting but challenging
  task  -and we want to make sure they are ready for it with the best possible foundation
  and tools. That's why we need your help to put together the <strong>Code for America
  Book List</strong>, a set of thought-provoking books to challenge, inspire and inform
  our fellows' work throughout the year. Submit your recommendations in the comments
  below.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-2089 alignleft\" title=\"Books\" src=\"http://codeforamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/3738107746_f944ec80b1.jpeg\"
  alt=\"\" width=\"350\" height=\"233\" />The emergence of <a href=\"http://opengovernment.labs.oreilly.com/ch01.html\">Gov
  2.0</a> is still fairly new, but there have been a lot of great books published
  in this space between government and technology. Our ideal list will go beyond just
  strictly Gov 2.0 works, however; it will include works on design, technology, culture,
  government, and leadership -the areas our fellows will need to be thinking hard
  and creatively about in order to succeed. We want to build a library the fellows
  will find useful on a daily basisas they tackle their projects, and inspiring as
  they think about their careers long-term.\r\n\r\nThis idea draws its inspiration

<p>In just a few weeks, our inaugural class of fellows will be coming together in San Francisco for the first time.

<p>We already have in hand, courtesy of O’Reilly Media, copies of <a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596804367"><em>Open Government</em></a> for each fellow. This fantastic compendium, edited by Laurel Ruma and Daniel Lathrop, is required reading for anyone wanting to understand this movement. Another book I’d personally place on the list is Clay Shirky’s <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2010/jun/27/cognitive-surplus-clay-shirky-book-review"><em>Cognitive Surplus</em></a>, which explains in refreshing and surprising ways what’s changed that makes a certain kind of civic engagement possible now. The fact that the term Gov 2.o appears nowhere in it makes it no less relevant. Anyone hoping to make technology-mediated collective efforts actually work should read this, so it goes on our list. I’d also consider classics like Edward Tufte’s <a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_vdqi"><em>Visual Display of Quantitative Information</em></a>, for its practical value in helping the fellows communicate their work.</p>
<p>We’re interested in the topics and thinkers that should be lunchroom conversation if we’re to succeed.Our fellows will read these books before and during orientation to provide a shared touchpoint to launch discussion and collaboration, and form a common ground upon which they can begin building their work. It’s our hope that they will be able to return to these key references for support and inspiration as they carry out their projects.</p>
<p>We want your help developing this list. What books have you found enlightening, inspiring, and thought-provoking? What do you think should be required reading for people working in the Gov 2.0 field? Now’s your chance to tell us.</p>
