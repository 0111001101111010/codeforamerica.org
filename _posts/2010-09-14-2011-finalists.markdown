By night, he dons a cape and fights   for urban sustainability by hacking away at Walkshed.org, a sophisticated   webapp to map walkability. Regardless of costume, Aaron especially enjoys   JavaScript development, GIS, and interesting ways of combining the two. Besides being a tech   geek, Aaron enjoys running with Back on My Feet, reading a good book,   backpacking hither and yon, a great cup of coffee, and the company of dear   friends and family.</p>
<p><strong>Anna Bloom<br/>
</strong><img align="right" alt="" hspace="5" src="https://codeforamerica.wufoo.com/cabinet/w7x3s5/FwuBelqFgeASSQ%3D/annavbloom_headshot.jpg" width="75px"/>Anna Bloom wants to join Code for America to continue making creative use   of technology to empower citizens and keep the public better informed. After   graduating from UC Berkeley’s Graduate School of Journalism in 2010, Anna   worked for YouTube to launch an innovative news project documenting the Bay   Area with user-generated video. Prior to that, she regularly contributed to   The New York Times Bay Area Blog and co-founded a hyper-local news site for   Oakland in 2008. Anna’s career began when she left Chicago for Park City,   Utah, to work as an editor for a newspaper to support her skiing habit.</p>
<p><strong>Aynne Valencia<br/>
</strong><img align="right" alt="" hspace="5" src="https://codeforamerica.wufoo.com/cabinet/w7x3s5/L2dIyojy16U%3D/aynnevalencia.jpg" width="75px"/>Aynne is a Design Leader who crafts the vision for next-gen products and   services. Her work centers on social, devices, experiences and space mediated   with computer-related devices.

She is active in   the design community, teaches and presents on topics related to design. She   is particularly interested in sensor-based ubiquitous and pervasive   computing.

What was common to both, according to Code for America applicant   and GIS professional Brian Denzer, was that government institutions were   failing for years, fostering the conditions for historically unprecedented   engineering disasters. As an advocate for using crowd-sourced application   development using government data to promote more open government and more   engaged citizens, Brian hopes to “catch-up” democratic institutions   to the 21st century, in order to prevent future such disasters. When he isn’t   making maps or advocating for government reform, Brian loves to partake in   the irreverence of Mardi Gras parades and (of course) cheering on the   world-champion Saints.</p>
