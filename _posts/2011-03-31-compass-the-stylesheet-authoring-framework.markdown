<p>Last week, Code for America got a visit from Chris Eppstein — creator of the Compass stylesheet authoring framework.  Chris stopped by to talk about the latest developments in Compass and SASS, as well as the all-around syntactic goodness of CSS3.<span id="more-4748"></span></p>
<p>SASS allows developers to use features like variables, loops, mixins and functions to write dynamic stylesheet code that is compiled into raw CSS.  This makes it much easier to develop and maintain large projects, where stylesheets can easily get out of control.  (As an example, Chris told us about a developer who uses SASS to set a single, base color on the project, which is then lightened, darkened, desaturated, etc, into different colors throughout the layout, and which can all be modified through a change to the base color).</p>
<p>Chris also walked us through some of the popular Compass libraries like sticky footers and sprites, which allow developers to mixin pre-baked (and cross-browser compatible) CSS instead of rolling their own on every new project.</p>
<p>Take a look at the new <a href="http://beta.compass-style.org" title="compass-style.org">Compass website</a>, and check back for updates on how Code for America is using Compass to standardize its styling across multiple projects.</p>
