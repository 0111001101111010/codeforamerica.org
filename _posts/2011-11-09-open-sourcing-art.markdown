Yes, you did read that right and no, I'm not making reference to our favorite Carl Malamud although that may come into play later. For the last year and a half I have been working on a very colorful and mind-warping project. In late 2009 I came up with an idea to build the world's largest Rubik's Cube mosaic. After a year of planning and some incredible luck and perseverance I completed the mosaic. It used 4,242 cubes and depicts the work of Martin Luther King through three portraits.

YCDTRC puts together educational kits that use Rubik's Cubes to teach school children about geometery, algebra, and a host of other skills. After the project wrapped up I wanted to continue working with the group and asked them if I could create a mosaic builder's guide book, like the one they already had for solving the cube. I also created a set of templates for them to use to create mosaics of famous historical figures (Mahatma Ghandi, Abraham Lincoln, Anne Frank, Nelson Mandela, Sitting Bull, and Albert Einstein). The new area of their program helps get kids interested in the cube and starts them off with some simple algorithms and is less daunting than solving the whole cube, it's effectively a gateway drug.

To continue this initiative, YCDTRC asked me to design a mosaic for the Bay Area Science Festival which took place this last weekend, Nov. 6 at AT&amp;T Park here in San Francisco. We enlisted the help of a group of speedcubers from U.C. Berkeley and it was my first time seeing kids using my work to get interested in math. It was amazing.
