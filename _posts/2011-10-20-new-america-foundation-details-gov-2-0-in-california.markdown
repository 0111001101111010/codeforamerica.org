<p>This morning the New America Foundation <a href="http://newamerica.net/publications/policy/hear_us_now">released a comprehensive Gov 2.0 report</a> about how California’s local governments are using technology to connect with the public and improve services. <a href="http://newamerica.net/publications/policy/hear_us_now">“Hear Us Now? A California Survey of Digital Technology’s Role in Civic Engagement and Local Government”</a> is a survey of 41 different innovations from across the state, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="direction: ltr;">The San Ramon Valley Fire Protection District’s text-message network to tap CPR-certified citizens when someone nearby reports a cardiac event.</span></li>
<li><span style="direction: ltr;">Riverside County’s use of digital channels to provide farmers with detailed weather data to promote more efficient irrigation and higher crop yields.</span></li>
<li><span style="direction: ltr;">Santa Cruz’s participatory budget process, San Francisco’s open-data clearinghouse, and more.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>One of the report’s top recommendations is for communities to implement a version of the Federal IT Dashboard, which <a href="http://civiccommons.org/2011/03/it-dashboard-open-sourced/">Civic Commons helped the OMB open source</a> earlier this year. The Dashboard tracks government technology spending — allowing the public to monitor how money is being spent. Earlier this year, it was estimated that the IT Dashboard had saved $3 billion. The New America Foundation recommended using the IT Dashboard as tool to track performance measures and metrics. There’s even a <a href="www.change.org/petitions/tell-san-francisco-city-leaders-bring-the-it-dashboard-to-city-hall">Change.org petition going around</a> now to encourage the City of San Francisco to implement the Dashboard.</p>
<p>Also, for those of you in the Bay Area, you can attend an Oct. 26 event at Stanford University, where the report will be discussed with policy experts and government officials; <a href="http://zocalopublicsquare.org/upcoming.php?event_id=489">RSVP here</a>. Code for America will be there talking about some of our projects in the context of the report.</p>
<p>To dive into the projects detailed in the report, check out the interactive map they put together, embedded below:<br/>
