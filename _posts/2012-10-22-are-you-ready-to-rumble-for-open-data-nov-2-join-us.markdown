<p><strong>Here’s your opportunity: Data DeathMatch! hackathon November 2.</strong><br/>
<strong>November 2</strong> from 6:30 – 8:00 p.m. (mixer/kickoff/getting started)<br/>
<strong>November 3</strong> from 9:00 a.m. – 7:00 p.m.<br/>
(hackathon)<br/>
<strong>Code for America Office:</strong> 155 9th St, San Francisco<br/>
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Sign-up:<a href="http://datadeathmatch.eventbrite.com/"> http://datadeathmatch.eventbrite.com</a></strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>All developers, designers, and community advocates with great ideas are welcome. We’ll have two tracks available for you to hack on. Choose your team. Fight for prizes. Food and beer are available for all participants.</p>
<p><strong>Government:</strong> The <a href="http://www.fppc.ca.gov/">Fair Political Practices Commission (FPPC)</a> of California (our state’s official watchdog that holds public officials accountable) has recently taken the bold step to make the 2011 economic interest filings of some California officials available as structured data, not just PDFs on a website. Build something that will help us hold our officials even more accountable. Staff from the FPPC and from the company <a href="http://www.captricity.com/">Captricity</a> (who’s API we’ll be using) will be on hand to help you through the process.</p>
<p><strong>Education:</strong> For developers looking to jump into the growing educational technology market, our partner <a href="http://www.learnsprout.com/">LearnSprout</a> offers a unique opportunity to turbo charge your idea. The company has built the first-ever API that allows you to tap into live data from a school or district’s Student Information System (SIS). This opens the door to countless possibilities that before, would be impossible without access to live data. Educators and the inventors of this awesome API will be on hand to help you integrate your app.</p>
<p>We’re giving you the platform to make our nation better in ways only hackers can. The only question left is, are you game?</p>
<p>Data DeathMatch. Be there.</p>
