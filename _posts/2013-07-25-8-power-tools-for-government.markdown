<p dir="ltr">We asked <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/">Code for America</a>’s geeks about their favorite web tools for productivity. These tools are all <strong>easy to use, require no computer programing skills, and free (at least up to a certain usage)</strong>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We hope some of these will help make your job easier!</p>
<p>Check them out and let us know if you have favorite tools that you think could help other people in government at the bottom of this post.</p>

<p dir="ltr">CartoDB is a web app (no installation necessary) that lets you easily put your data on a nice-looking map and share it publicly. It’s as easy as dragging and dropping your data file and clicking some buttons. CartoDB is free for up to five tables and five megabites of (public) data, with <a href="http://cartodb.com/pricing">reasonable pricing</a> after that.</p>
