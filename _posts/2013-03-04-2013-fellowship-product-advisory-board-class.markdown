<p>Code for America’s 2013 Fellows are getting a little extra help this year in the development of web applications to service city needs. They’ll have leaders in product design, delivery, and measurement providing guidance and feedback to the them during our app development phase between March to October. We’re ecstatic to have them on board and cannot wait to see the tremendous value they provide to our Fellows and the Civic Tech movement this year.</p>
