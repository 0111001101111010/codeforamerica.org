<p>As we approach the <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/fellows/apply"><strong>deadline for our Early Decision application for the 2012 fellowship</strong></a>, I wanted to share with you a story from one of our current fellows, <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/author/karla">Karla Macedo</a> — an “artist at heart and graphic designer by trade.” In just a few months, she’s already made an imprint on this organization, both through her paintbrush and her passion, and you can see for yourself why she’s coding for America:</p>

<p>I worked with 2011 fellows <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/author/anna">Anna Bloom</a> and <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/author/anna">Scott Silverman</a> to create the video, from interviewing and shooting b-roll, to editing and motion graphics. We enjoyed getting to know Karla better by following her to SF MOMA to check out some of her favorite artists, and going through her personal sketchbook. We are excited to share with you our profile of one of the creative powerhouses behind what we do. We will be doing several more fellow profiles so you can get a better sense of what it’s like to be a Code for America fellow. Look out for new videos over the weeks and months to come, and <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/apply">apply now for the Code for America fellowship: http://codeforamerica.org/apply</a></p>
