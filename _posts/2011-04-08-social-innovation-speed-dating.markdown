<p><a href="http://simpl.co" target="_blank">Simpl</a> hosted <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/2011/03/22/sfspeeddating/">Social Innovation Speed Dating</a> in our offices at Code for America. About 30 people showed up on Tuesday evening, ready to pitch an idea and find others willing to help. Simpl provides a market place to share social innovation ideas with others. Now combine that idea with speed dating… and you get Social Innovation Speed Dating.</p>
<p>Each participant was given a sheet of paper to get the contact information of people who could help with an idea. The speed daters went through several rounds of pitching ideas to each other.  At the end of the night most people came away with someone that could help on their social innovation idea or at least more ideas to help further the innovation.</p>
