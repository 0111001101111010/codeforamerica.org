It's difficult to define participation and it's even more difficult to measure it. In Philadelphia, for example, the <a href="http://philly.changeby.us/" target="_blank">Change By Us</a> platform that launched last month is attracting a number of residents who want to work together to make Philadelphia a better city. But how does the local government measure their participation, is it simply number of users? That can't be the complete picture because their impact isn't captured in that measurement. These are just some of the challenges the City of Philadelphia and Code for America have faced while trying to measure public participation.

Therefore, it's no surprise the Federal government is asking for help to determine the best practices and metrics for public participation. On <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2011/12/06/seeking-your-input-us-open-government-national-action-plan" target="_blank">December 6</a> they began seeking <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/webform/seeking-your-input-open-government-national-action-plan" target="_blank">input</a> on the best practices and metrics for public participation as part of their larger <a href="http://www.opengovpartnership.org/sites/www.opengovpartnership.org/files/country_action_plans/US_National_Action_Plan_Final_2.pdf" target="_blank">US National Open Government Action Plan</a>. We have been similarly challenged at Code for America in our public participation projects. We've found that collaboration, participation, and engagement can mean very different things to different groups of people and governments. In our projects we've tried to think of participation in its broadest sense, and build online tools that make participation easy, social, and widespread.

In our search to answer these tough questions <a href="http://www.civiccommons.org" target="_blank">Civic Commons</a> has pulled together a number of online resources that can help frame best practices for civic engagement. The <a href="http://wiki.civiccommons.org/" target="_blank">wiki</a> has helpful information and examples of participation, transparency, open data, and open source in action.

Another helpful resource designed for local officials is <a href="http://www.nlc.org/find-city-solutions/research-innovation/governance-civic-engagement/planning-for-stronger-local-democracy" target="_blank">Planning for Stronger Local Democracy: A Field Guide for Local Officials</a>. The field guide is a toolkit designed to assist officials in strengthening local democracy by cultivating transparency and inclusivity with citizens.

I encourage you to participate and <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/webform/seeking-your-input-open-government-national-action-plan" target="_blank">contribute your thoughts</a> to the White House to help shape the way our government thinks about and measures participation. It's not an easy task and they shouldn't be doing it alone. Share your input by January 3, 2012.
