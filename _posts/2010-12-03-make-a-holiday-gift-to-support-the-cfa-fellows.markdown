  alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"198\" /></a>The holidays can be exciting times with
  lots to do. Our small team here at Code for America is feeling the holiday spirit,
  and also the crunch! In just a few weeks, we will welcome the inaugural class of
  CfA Fellows. These brave and talented souls will really begin to bring our mission
  to life, working hand in hand with staff in cities to help make government more
  efficient and open. But to set them up for success, we need <a href=\"http://bit.ly/cfa-gift10\">your
  help</a>!\r\n\r\nWe'll be spending the month of January outfitting our office so
  the fellows will have a place to collaborate, learn, and build new kinds of solutions
  for citizens and governments. We're brand new, so we're missing some of the basics,
  like chairs, monitors, and a conference table. We know that as the year closes out,
  many of you are looking for worthy charities to support. Will you consider <a href=\"http://bit.ly/cfa-gift10\">making
  a tax-deductible donation</a> to Code for America to help us create a space for
  this important, game-changing work?\r\n\r\nWhile we welcome a donation of any amount,
  you can take this opportunity to sponsor a tangible piece of our new workspace,
  <a href=\"http://bit.ly/cfa-gift10\">your holiday gift to the Code for America movement</a>.\r\n\r\n<strong><em>Our
  Holiday Wish List</em></strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"http://bit.ly/cfa-gift10\"><img

  at any level are appreciated, and of course, we welcome your <a href=\"http://codeforamerica.org/supplies\">in-kind
  donations</a>. The work of the Code for America Fellows relies on a belief that
  a group of passionate people can make a difference. If you share that belief, won't
  you please help us bring it to life?"
