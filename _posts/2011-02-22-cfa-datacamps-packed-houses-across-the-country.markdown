<p><img alt="Grouping discussion topics for the morning's talks" class="alignright" src="http://codeforamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/5462587059_cfb2e24689.jpeg" width="350"/>While our fellows are in their cities during February, they aren’t working 9am to 5pm; it’s more like 6am to 11pm. From the hundreds of interviews they’re conducting to develop the projects to the local events they’re attending to build communities, they’ve got a lot to do. I’ve asked them how they’re able to keep going, day after day, hour after hour, and almost uniformly I hear some variant of this response: “When you see the response from the people we’re talking to, it’s impossible to stop. You just want to keep working.”</p>
<p>There has been indeed quite a response from citizens in each of our cities to our work. In particular, we’ve been hosting DataCamps across the country over the past few weeks in Seattle, Boston, and DC, and we’re hosting <strong><a href="http://datacampphl.eventbrite.com/">our final event for February in Philadelphia this Friday</a></strong>. These events focus on leveraging the data cities can open up and — to paraphrase Bill Shrier, CIO of Seattle — “turning that data into information.” We’ll be posting updates from each event over the next week or so, and you’ll be able to read about what was learned, shared, and built. In the meantime, we wanted to highlight some of the great coverage of the events:</p>
<h2><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/alexander-howard/civic-developers-code-for_b_825818.html">Alex Howard in the <em>Huffington Post</em></a></h2>
<blockquote><p>This past weekend, civic developers gathered at a Seattle data camp to code for America. This Presidents’ Day, the day before George Washington’s Birthday, dozens of government technologists, data nerds, civic hackers and citizens from around the District of Columbia, Virginia and Maryland will join Code for America fellows for a datacamp at Big Window Labs…</p>
<p>This example of directed action at an unconference has fast become the next step in the evolution of camps, where a diverse set of volunteers come together to donate more than money or blood: they exchange information and then apply their skills to creating solutions to the needs defined by a given set of societal challenges.</p>
<p>This model of directed civic involvement has became a global phenomenon in wake of the crisis camps that sprung up after the earthquake in Haiti last year. The cultural DNA of these camps has evolved into CrisisCommons, which has acted as platform for volunteers to donate their skills to help in natural disasters and other crises.</p></blockquote>
<h2><a href="http://gumption.typepad.com/blog/2011/02/civic-hacktivism-at-data-camp-seattle.html">Joe McCarthy on <em>Gumption</em></a></h2>
<blockquote><p>I wasn’t sure what to expect going into the event, but was greatly impressed with the interactions, overall experience and outcomes at Data Camp Seattle. I’ve admired the Code for America project since first learning about it, and have been a proponent of open data and platform thinking (and doing) on my blog. It was inspiring and empowering to have an opportunity to do more than simply blog about these topics … though I recognize the potential irony of writing that statement in a new blog post about these topics.</p>
<p>I suspect that one of the most durable outcomes of the Code for America project will be this kind of projection or radiation of civic empowerment through – and beyond – the efforts of the CfA fellows and their collaboration partners. In The Wealth of Networks, Yochai Benkler writes about how “[t]he practice of producing culture makes us all more sophisticated readers, viewers, and listeners, as well as more engaged makers”. In Program or Be Programmed, Doug Rushkoff warns against “relinquishing our nascent collective agency” to computers and the people who program them by engaging in “a renaissance of human capacity” by becoming programmers ourselves.</p>
<p>While many – or even most – of the specific applications we designed and developed during the Data Camp Seattle civic hackathon may not gain widespread traction and use, if the experience helps more of us shift our thinking – and doing – toward becoming co-creators of civic applications – and civic engagement – then the Code for America project will have succeeded in achieving some grand goals indeed.</p></blockquote>
