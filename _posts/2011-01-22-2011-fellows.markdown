Code for America's inaugural fellowship class brought a number of amazing candidates to the organization.  Candidates came in from across the country and around the world, and they came with backgrounds ranging from back-end development experience to urban design. From that tremendous applicant pool, we worked with our selection committee of leading technologists, city officials, and thought leaders to identify the top for next year. Below are short biographies for those selected for the 2011 Code for America Fellows.
