Joe Merante is an Internet lawyer, web developer, and musician. Joe co-founded a business networking company and worked at a music publishing agency prior to attending law school. During law school, he contributed to Peer to Patent and open government research in addition to completing legal internships at Creative Commons and eMusic. Since passing the New York bar exam, he has built websites for healthcare practitioners and nonprofits. Joe holds a BA from Berklee College of Music and a JD from New York Law School.

This year, Joe's work has focused on building applications, community and open government policy for the City of Austin. He's also expanded his technical skills beyond prior PHP and Drupal experience to include Ruby, Rails, git, more Javascript, a bit of Python and working with NoSQL databases. Joe would like to continue improving his coding and project management skills in a business or startup setting. He remains interested in Internet law and policy opportunities as well. More:
