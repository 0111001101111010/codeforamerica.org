<p>Last week our very own Jennifer Pahlka (CfA founder and executive director) was named the Ultimate Game Changer in Business and Tech by Huffington Post.  Pahlka has worked in the tech industry for the past 10 years. In 2009 she noticed the need for civic innovation, and drawing on her tech industry experience and network, founded Code for America.</p>
<p>Each year Huffington Post selects 100 innovators and visionaries, and then polls its readers to whittle it down to 12 – the Ultimate Game Changers for each of its 12 categories: Politics, Green, Media, Entertainment, Food and Travel, Style, Culture, Business and Tech, World, Sports, Healthy Living, Impact and Education.</p>
<p>“I’m honored because this draws attention to the truly great work of our partners in City Hall and our fellows, who have taken a year out of their lives to serve our country — both groups are lending their extraordinary talents to recrafting the relationship between citizens and government.” said Pahlka.</p>
