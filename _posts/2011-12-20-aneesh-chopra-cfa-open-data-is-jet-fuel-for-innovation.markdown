<p>As the United States Chief Technology Officer, Aneesh Chopra is our nation’s chief geek. On a recent trip to San Francisco, he chose Code for America to convene local tech leaders along with our 2011 Fellows, to lay out a vision for how open data will fuel American innovation.</p>
<p>Chopra is a force of nature. We’ve heard reports that he writes his email in binary code. We admit that’s probably White House folklore. However, what is undeniable is Chopra’s ability to command a room chock-full of civic geeks, and his unparalled ability to facilitate collaboration between technologists for public good.</p>
