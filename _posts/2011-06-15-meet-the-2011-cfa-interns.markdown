Last week, over a dozen new recruits joined Code for America to work on projects ranging from design and code to policy and outreach — thanks in no small part to the support of <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/2011/03/28/cfa-google-summer-of-code/">Google Summer of Code</a> and the other organizations that made this program possible for the students. They kicked off the internship last week with a mini-CfA Training, with trainings on government and technology, and throughout the summer, they’ll receive mentorship and support from our fellows and advisors.</p>
<p>We’re very excited to see what this terrific, diverse, and talented class can do. For now, as the summer is just getting started, we’re pleased to introduce you to the 2011 CfA Summer Interns:</p>
