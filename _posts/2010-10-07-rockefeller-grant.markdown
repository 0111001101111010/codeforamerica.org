excerpt: "A core idea motivating Code for America is that our cities could work better
  if we could bring the best thinking from government together with the best thinking
  from the tech industry. Diverse and meaningful collaboration, we believe, is the
  key to innovation. Now thanks to the support of the Rockefeller Foundation, we have
  the opportunity to achieve this in a very real way.\r\n\r\nWe are pleased to announce
  a generous grant of $200,000 from the Rockefeller Foundation. The grant will fund
  brainstorming sessions in our 2011 cities - where leaders from the tech industry
  and city hall will come together and take that city's project to the white board,
  asking tough questions and searching for solutions. Through those conversations,
  we will explore and document the enablers and barriers to city adoption of web apps
  as platforms for transparency, efficiency and citizen participation. We will develop
  a playbook for achieving lasting change at the municipal level. This research is
  critical to our projects' success."

A core idea motivating Code for America is that our cities could work better if we could bring the best thinking from government together with the best thinking from the tech industry. Diverse and meaningful collaboration, we believe, is the key to innovation. Now thanks to the support of the Rockefeller Foundation, we have the opportunity to achieve this in a very real way.

We are pleased to announce a generous grant of $200,000 from the Rockefeller Foundation. The grant will fund brainstorming sessions in our 2011 cities - where leaders from the tech industry and city hall will come together and take that city's project to the white board, asking tough questions and searching for solutions. Through those conversations, we will explore and document the enablers and barriers to city adoption of web apps as platforms for transparency, efficiency and citizen participation. We will develop a playbook for achieving lasting change at the municipal level. This research is critical to our projects' success.<a id="more"></a><a id="more-1704"></a>

Throughout its long history, the foundation has paid special attention to the role of cities and their needs through grants, research, and partnerships. Each year, for example, they award the Jane Jacobs medal to visionary urban activists whose "creative uses of the urban environment build a more diverse, dynamic and equitable city." The prize is named after influential writer and activist Jane Jacobs who wrote, "Cities have the capability of providing something for everyone only because and only when they are created by everybody." Because we share this commitment to cities, especially at this crucial moment, we're excited to be receiving this grant from the Rockefeller Foundation.

We believe cities demand innovation and fresh thinking now more than ever to maintain their critical role in civic life. As ICMA's report Navigating the Fiscal Crisis says, "Local leaders can use hard times to pursue organizational change or shed outmoded business practices that might seem too risky when all economic indicators are positive." One city manager put it this way, "We have no choice; we need to do things differently. I'm ready to do what it takes."

This is why we're working to find out exactly what it takes. Code for America's hope is to relay the constant innovation of the tech industry into the halls of city government. Standing between the two is a culture that is often siloed, stagnant, and resistant to change. But the cities we've partnered with in 2011 are ready for change, ready to to collaborate, and ready to innovate. This, along with the caliber of our city applications we're developing with them, give us reason to think change is possible, and we will use our brainstorms to identify how -- for the benefit of our cities and all others.
