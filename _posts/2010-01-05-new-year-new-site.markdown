While most of the work so far has taken place behind the scenes (talking to cities and foundations, and work on ramping up the organization and applications), we're starting off the new year rolling out a new public-facing site.

Over the next few days we'll be adding more pages.  To keep up with the latest, follow us on twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/codeforamerica">@codeforamerica</a>.
