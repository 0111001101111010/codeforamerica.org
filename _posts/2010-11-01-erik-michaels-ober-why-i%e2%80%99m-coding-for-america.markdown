<p>Despite my interest in public service, I’ve spent my entire career working with technology startups in the private sector. This decision was mostly a pragmatic one. When I graduated from college, I had no savings and lots of debt. Computer programming was my most employable skill. While I’ve enjoyed the work I’ve done and lessons I’ve learned over the past five years, I’d like to apply that knowledge and experience to serve my country.</p>
