The Code for America model relies on making connections -- connections between governments wanting change and passionate citizens able to deliver it. These are connections that too often go unmade, but we're working to change that. Our fellowship connects talented web professionals with city governments to solve core problems, and now we're partnering with <a href="http://wearefuturegov.com/">FutureGov</a> and <a href="http://simpl.co">Simpl</a> to get more people in on the game, to make it easier, quicker, and -- well -- simpler for cities great ideas to partner with people who can make them happen.

It's called <a href="http://simplcfasf.eventbrite.com">Social Innovation Speed Dating</a>. And it's an event where we open up our SF offices to citizens and city officials with ideas, skills, or resources looking for a match; they go around the room, playing the field, seeing what's out there for a partnership; and by the end of night, they walk away with <del>numbers</del> -- er, email addresses and business cards. It's actually just how it sounds: speed dating but for civic problem-solving. And not to worry, we'll have snacks and drinks to ease things along.

<strong>Who should come?</strong> You might be a government employee with great ideas, a social innovator or a San Francisco resident looking to make change happen. Ideally you'll have either a problem that you're looking for help to take on or skills and resources you can bring to bear.

<strong>What kinds of problems?</strong> It can be anything ranging from "I wish there was a web app for that form" to "I think the city should have a better way to engage citizens" or even an idea for a new non-profit or start-up.

<strong>What do you need to bring to the table?</strong> Anything really. Technical skills, desk space, a spare monitor, or just some free time. Even if you think you don't have anything to offer, come and talk to a few people, and you'll quickly realize that you do.

Fortunately, FutureGov, run by friend of CfA, Dominic Campbell, has run a few of these events with great success (<a href="http://www.simpl.co/blog/2010/10/27/social-innovation-matchmaking-comes-to-washington-dc/">check out coverage</a> of their Social Speed Dating in DC), and we're looking forward to working with them to make <a href="simplcfasf.eventbrite.com">Speed Dating SF</a> a success.
