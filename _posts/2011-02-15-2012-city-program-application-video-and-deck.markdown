<p><!-- p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica} -->The <a href="http://www.formstack.com/forms/?1018282-aijP78y1c7" target="_blank">application</a> deadline to our <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/cities/city-impact/" target="_blank">2012 City Program</a> is around the corner, <strong>March 1st</strong>.  To prepare our applicants we hosted a <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/2011/01/26/a-new-kind-of-solution-learn-how-your-city-can-partner-with-cfa/" target="_blank">webinar</a> last week that discussed the application process, featured an interview with Boston’s CIO Bill Oates, and gave participants time to ask questions they wanted answered.</p>
<p>Bill Oates talked about his interest in our program and how Code for America’s different approach to solving problems aligned very well with how his team and the city likes to work. We asked Bill about his justification for funding our program and he said, “when we looked at the totality of the program, it was very clear to me that this investment the city was making… there was no question that this was going to be a great value for the city.”</p>
<p>We also had great questions from the participants about the participation fee, consideration of county or other levels of government partners, and how cities plan to maintain and grow our solutions after the fellowship year.</p>
<p>For those of you who were not able to participate we’ve posted a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWwbcBCudwc" target="_blank">video</a> of the presentation and a slide <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/alissa007/code-for-america-2012-program-application-process" target="_blank">deck</a>, both are available below.</p>
