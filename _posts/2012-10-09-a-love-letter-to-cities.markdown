<p>My love affair with cities, San Francisco in particular, started early. Though my parents moved from San Francisco to the suburbs before I turned one, we visited the city often. One of my earliest memories of the City: In the family car driving up Interstate 280, face pressed to the window, I look out at the <a href="http://www.foundsf.org/index.php?title=Mission_Creek" target="_blank">houseboats anchored in Mission Creek</a> and wish that I could live there.</p>
