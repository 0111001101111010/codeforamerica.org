March marks and exciting month for Code for America for two reasons.  First, it marks the return of our 2013 Fellows - they have just returned to San Francisco from their month-long residency in their respective cities and counties.  Secondly, at the end of the month, our application process for 2014 Fellowship cities/counties will close.  We'll know which cities and counties, big and small, all across America are looking to code for America in 2014.

Over the past several months I've had the unique opportunity to speak with change agents in local government about the Code for America Fellowship and the incredible value the program provides their community.  If you've wanted to learn more about the Fellowship, or if your city is considering applying for a slot in the program, you should watch this amazing video. The video highlights some of our former and current partners inside city halls.  While I could talk all day about the amazing work of <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/fellows" target="_blank">our Fellows</a>, I don't think anything, or anyone, quite articulates the effect of the fellows and the power of the Fellowship program like those we've worked with, day-in and day-out.

If you're like Amanda Deaton, John Tolva, Mayor Joe Reardon, Peter Koht, Karla Henderson, or Allen Square, or any of our dedicated partners in local government -- who deserve a standing ovation of their own -- and you want to impact change in your city or county, watch this video. And, afterwards take a look at the application <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/gov2014" target="_blank">here</a>.
