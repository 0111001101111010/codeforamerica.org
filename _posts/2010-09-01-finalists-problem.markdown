<strong><em>Deadline: September 13</em></strong>

As a finalist, you've already demonstrated great experience, passion, or drive. We want to see how you attack a problem. You can respond in whatever format best shows off your skill set: you can provide us with a code snippet, essay, design, wireframes, workflow chart, comic book, storyboard, charts and graphs, etc -- whatever will give us the best sense of your thinking, creativity, and skills.

<strong>Please review the problem statement below and respond by September 13 to <a href="mailto:info@codeforamerica.org">info@codeforamerica.org</a>.</strong>

<strong>Problem Statement
</strong> The City of Boston is rolling out a universal ID card to every high school student to keep track of attendance, library use, participation in after-school community groups and organizations, and public transit. Boston's goals in this effort are:
<ul>
	<li>To keep students in school and improve their attendance records;</li>
	<li>To get students using the wide variety of resources in their communities to enhance their education, and to see that education is a process that extends beyond the walls of their school;</li>
	<li>To collect and understand data about the effectiveness of various programs that the City funds (after school and community group programs, for example, which will use the ID card system);</li>
	<li>To improve the overall effectiveness of community's education system.</li>
</ul>
What would you do with this data to achieve one or more of Boston's goals?

Be sure to state whatever assumptions you make in crafting your response, and while we realize privacy issues are relevant, don't let those concerns limit your thinking too much -- just keep them in mind.

<strong>Response is mandatory and due by September 13 to<a href="mailto:info@codeforamerica.org">info@codeforamerica.org</a>.</strong>
