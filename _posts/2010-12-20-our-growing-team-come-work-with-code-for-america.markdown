Every day we come closer to the start of our inaugural fellowship program. That means that 20 bright and talented web professionals will begin their journey at the intersection of technology and government. And that also means that we will expand from a small team of just a handful of staff to an organization of over two dozen, working with growing project teams in four cities. The times, they are a-changing. With that change comes the need for greater operational and administrative support.

<strong><a href="http://codeforamerica.org/jobs">Now Hiring: Office Coordinator</a>
</strong>To that end, we are now hiring for a new position on the Code for America Team: <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/jobs">Office Coordinator</a>. This is a full-time job -- and then some -- and it'll require someone who is dedicated, organized, resourceful, efficient, competent, and entrepreneurial. They'll not only have the challenge of handling our often chaotic staff and keeping the trains running on time, but also the responsibility to think creatively about the organization and help make it grow. We're a start-up, but the non-profit kind, so we can't offer you stock. What we can offer is a network of emerging civic and tech leaders, the autonomy to lead projects on your own, and a voice in shaping the future of this movement. More for information about position including a full job description with requirements and expectations is <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/jobs">available here</a> and you can apply by sending your resume, a link to your linkedin profile, and salary requirements to <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/jobs">jobs@codeforamerica.org</a>.

<strong>Welcome Max and Lauren!
</strong>Whoever ends up in this role will -- thankfully -- have some help. We're also pleased to announce and even happier to have on board a few impressive college students as interns. Lauren Dyson is a senior Media Studies major at Vassar College. She spent the past summer in Washington DC as a Google Policy Fellow, working with the Internet Education Foundation and the Congressional Internet Caucus Advisory Committee to promote informed decision-making by policymakers on technology policy issues. The previous summer, she researched children's online safety in developing nations at the Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society at Harvard University in collaboration with UNICEF. Max Fram-Schwartz is a junior at Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota, majoring in Math and Economics. His background covers both government and technology. He has interned on Capitol Hill with the House Judiciary Committee, as well  in New York at a tech start-up, SeatGeek, developing their social media marketing and business development efforts. With a strong passion for service work, he cycled across the country from Florida to San Francisco, to raise money and awareness for affordable housing. These two have already made huge contributions to the team, particularly with our city recruitment efforts and holiday fundraising push, and we're excited to see what they accomplish in the months ahead.

Everything we do is only possible because of the people who are willing to take a risk and get involved. We hope you share our excitement and consider joining our passionate team.
