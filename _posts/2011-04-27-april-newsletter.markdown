Dear Friends of CfA Boston,

Thank you for your ongoing support and attention. The last time we had a chance to talk with many of you was February, so we wanted to take this opportunity to say hello again and give you a quick update on what CfA Boston has been up to and what we have planned.

<strong>Back to San Francisco (and sunshine).</strong>
Over the month of February, Code for America's Boston Team conducted 113 interviews, including many of you. Thank you! Upon our return to San Francisco in March, we read through each of these interviews, searching for commonalities and problem areas. Next we spent several days brainstorming alongside the Mayor's Office of New Urban Mechanics to generate project ideas, research possible solutions, and come to consensus on our best options.

<strong>Lots of ideas, but what to build?</strong>
Towards the end of March, the Code for America Boston team pitched five product ideas gleaned from our interviews in February. Together with representatives from the City and CfA staff, we determined which ideas were most feasible and most inline with our shared values and goals: a SMS student homework notifier app, a <em>Where's My School Bus?</em> app, and a Boston API data platform.

<strong>Ready, set, code!</strong>
Once our team had a concrete idea of what we would be developing, we began a review of existing technologies and platforms upon which we might build. Is there an existing solution available? What open-source tools might we utilize? What products we can learn from? This review allowed us to develop a specification and feature set for our products. Soon after, we began development and are currently in the midst of building these products.

<strong>Applications need beta testers.</strong>
As we progress with the development of these applications, we will be looking to get them into the hands of some real users for feedback. As beta testers, we need teachers, students, parents, developers, and you! If you would like early-access to the products and applications we are developing (or know someone who would), <a href="mailto:boston@codeforamerica.org">please let us know</a>.

<strong>American Planning Association Conference</strong>
We were at APA's 2011 National Planning Conference in Boston where more than 5,000 planners, officials, and citizens gathered from April 9 – 12, 2011. The four-day conference addressed the many challenges cities across the United States are faced with today, covering topics such as: rapid bus transit, urban agriculture, economic development, and shrinking cities. Have a read on <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/2011/04/27/apa-conference/">what we learned</a>!

<strong>Let's keep in touch!</strong>
We'd love to keep in touch with all the amazing people we've met along the way. Please feel free to contact us if you have something to share, want to get involved or just want to say hello. We're always looking for new and innovative ways to get things done. You can also follow along online, as we <a title="Blogging for America" href="http://codeforamerica.org/blog/" target="_blank">love to blog</a>!

<strong>See you sooner rather than later.</strong>
From time to time it only makes sense to have meetings in person. Fellows Scott Silverman and Joel Mahoney will be in Boston from May 2 - 4, 2011, so we'll see you soon!
