<p><em>RSVP for Part II of our Fellowship Projects webinar series, at 10 a.m. Pacific (1 p.m. Eastern) on September 18, 2012. <a href="http://cfa2012webinar.eventbrite.com/">Register here</a>.</em></p>
<p>More than eighty of you joined us for our <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/2012/08/17/reusable-civic-technology-urban-legend-or-urban-reality/">first-ever Fellowship Projects webinar</a>. It was a fantastic chance to connect with a wider group about what the 2012 fellows have been working on. The attendees included city officials from Bloomington, Ind. to West Hollywood, Calif., Brigade members from all over the country with strong representation from our <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/2012/08/23/introducing-the-brigade-captains-program/">new Brigade Captains</a>, students, community members, and even a few folks tuned in internationally.</p>
<p>We heard from three of our 2012 city teams about projects they’ve been building this year:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.textizen.com/welcome">Textizen</a>, with Alex Yule from team Philadelphia</li>
<li><a href="http://opencounter.org/santacruz/">OpenCounter</a>, with Ruthie Bendor from team Santa Cruz, Calif.</li>
<li><a href="http://golocaldata.com/">LocalData</a>, with Alicia Rouault from team Detroit</li>
</ul>
<p>Each shared a preview of what they’ve built so far, where they envision the project going — and how individuals interested in bringing the app to their city can get involved. As we <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/2012/08/17/reusable-civic-technology-urban-legend-or-urban-reality/">wrote earlier</a>, the impact of these apps can scale far beyond the cities for which they were originally built: they can all be adapted and reused to fit the needs of other cities and communities. Some, like Textizen, have <a href="http://plansaltlake.com/join-the-textizen-revolution/">already been reused</a> in several cities, and others will be ready in the next few months and weeks.</p>
<p>And the first step towards making this happen is getting the conversation started about what’s available, how it can be reused, and what the next steps are to redeployment. That’s why it was great to have a chance to spark a dialogue with the audience during our webinar’s Q&amp;A session, and get the fellows and audience talking and exchanging ideas directly. One viewer, for example, suggested partnering with local access radio and television stations to publicize Textizen surveys via PSAs — an idea that Team Textizen hadn’t thought of yet and agreed would be a smart strategy for increasing citizen engagement with their app.</p>
<p>It’s this kind of exchange and conversation that we love seeing unfold. We’ll be posting the video of the webinar soon, where you can watch the full presentation and find out the answers to audience questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>How did Ruthie, a fellow on team Santa Cruz, decide to focus on business permitting for her project, and what has it been like working with the Planning Department?</li>
<li>How hard is it to redeploy LocalData? Can a non-technical community organizer do it?</li>
<li>What other projects are being built for Philly this year?</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on the interest in the first webinar, we’ll be hosting a second webinar featuring three more 2012 Code for America projects on September 18, 2012. It’ll be another chance to dive deeper into this year’s projects, ask questions and connect with the fellows, and find out how these apps could work in your city. <a href="http://cfa2012webinar.eventbrite.com/">Register to attend now</a>!</p>
