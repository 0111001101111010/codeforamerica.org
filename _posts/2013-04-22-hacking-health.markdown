<p><em>This is a guest post contributed by Jennifer Lee and Catherine Bostian of <a href="http://www.health2con.com/" target="_blank">Health 2.0</a>.</em></p>
<p>This May will bring together technology and healthcare is a whole new way. <a href="http://www.healthrefactored.com/">Health:Refactored</a>, a code and design focused conference for health, will help you leap forward in your quest to improve people’s lives. Taking place at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, May 13 – 14, the conference will provide developers and designers with the opportunity to hone health tech skills, access coveted industry APIs, and interact with industry leaders in user-led sessions.</p>
<p>By attending, developers and designers will learn how to build and scale impactful products to improve people’s health and the healthcare system that serves them.</p>
<p>The health tech industry is rapidly evolving; according to <a href="http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/mhealth-app-market-poised-big-growth">a recent Healthcare IT News article</a>, the mobile health market alone is poised to grow 61 percent by 2017, and be worth $26 billion. The evolution of health technology into solutions that solve complex problems and integrate more easily into daily life translates into a huge potential to improve health and lives. However, the legacy systems at most healthcare organizations in the U.S, are archaic with barriers to integration. Increasing federal regulation, limited device interoperability, big datasets, murky got-to-market strategies, and product usability can prevent, or halt, the creation of new health solutions. In the face of these challenges, we need the most talented and civic minded folks to boldly enter the health care arena and create solutions that will change the health of communities across the world.</p>
<p>At Health:Refactored you can learn the ins and outs of health tech design, data, law, biz dev, and the healthcare ecosystem to build for health. Experts will provide intensive talks and also trouble-shoot the toughest questions at the Open Mic Soapbox. There will be keynotes by CTO of the US Dept of Health and Human Services <a href="http://www.health2con.com/events/speaker/bryan-sivak/">Bryan Sivak</a>, Microsoft’s distinguished engineer <a href="http://www.health2con.com/events/speaker/sean-nolan/">Sean Nolan</a>, and a dueling keynote between Health IT specialist <a href="http://www.health2con.com/events/speaker/fred-trotter/">Fred Trotter</a> and e-patient <a href="http://www.health2con.com/events/speaker/karen-herzog/">Karen Herzog</a>. We hope you’ll be inspired by demos and talks by experts from <a href="http://www.ideo.com/">IDEO</a>, <a href="https://jawbone.com/">Jawbone</a>, <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/">Mayo Clinic</a>, <a href="http://www.fitbit.com/">FitBit</a>, <a href="http://www.mapmyfitness.com/">MapMyFitness</a>, the <a href="http://www.mapmyfitness.com/">Mashery</a>, and <a href="http://www.athenahealth.com/">athenahealth.</a></p>
<p>Outside of the sessions, attendees will have the opportunity to build on industry APIs at workshops byIntel, Walgreens, Nuance, New York eHealth Collaborative, MedHelp, and Achievement.</p>
<p>Build to make a difference.</p>
