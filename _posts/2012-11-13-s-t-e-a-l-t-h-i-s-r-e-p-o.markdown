<p>Blockee is a web application that lets you visualize improvements to your block. It was built as a Labs Friday project by <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/jesse-bounds/" target="_blank">Jesse Bounds</a>, <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/nick-doiron/" target="_blank">Nick Doiron</a>, <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/serena-wales/" target="_blank">Serena Wales</a> and <a href="http://tamarashopsin.com/" target="_blank">myself</a>. You can try it out at <a href="http://blockee.org/" target="_blank">Blockee.org</a>.</p>
<p>Initially the app was made as a steam valve, a way to work on something fun. A goof that let us play with node.js, canvas, sparkles, and multiple API’s. A goof we hoped would get a few people thinking about their neighborhood.</p>
<p>With more than 10,000 visits since it launched in September the response to Blockee has been a surprise.</p>
<p>Some of the visits can be seen on <a href="http://blockeedotorg.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Blockee’s Tumblr</a> (beta) that automatically grabs and displays shared Blockees.</p>
<p>Jason Hibbets (@jhibbets) of  Raleigh, N.C. used blockee in a<a href="http://seeclickfix.com/issues/241290" target="_blank"> See Click Fix</a> post about needing crosswalks, and the city of Raleigh, N.C. responded with a work order.</p>

<p>This got us thinking about how easy it would be to integrate Blockee with <a href="http://seeclickfix.com/" target="_blank">See Click Fix</a> or <a href="http://311labs.org/" target="_blank">Open 311</a> and create a Blockee that would report problems:</p>

<p>Andrew Nicklin ‏(@technickle) <a href="https://twitter.com/technickle/status/253192379002134532" target="_blank">tweeted</a> about the possibility of using Blockee as a community-facing tool for New York. Exciting because NYC is a 2013 CfA city and my hometown.</p>
<p>Other potential uses include: A teaching aid for children. A planning and zoning tool. Simply tailoring it to suit specific non-profits such as Habitat for Humanity.</p>
<p>But our fellowship is over.</p>
<p>So we invite you to fork, steal, copy, transmogrify, re-use or improve Blockee.</p>
<p>Blockee’s GitHub repo can be found <a href="https://github.com/codeforamerica/blockee" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><em>Update: Inspired the 2013 fellows to start <a href="http://codeforamerica.github.com/streetmix/" target="_blank">experimenting</a>.<em></em></em></p>
