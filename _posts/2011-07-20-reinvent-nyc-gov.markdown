<p>Last week, <a href="http://www.govtech.com/wireless/Bloomberg-Web-Design-Ideas-NYCgov.html?elq=d02186c6bf7c49a9aec6d77ef230f0c9">New York City announced</a> its first ever hackathon aimed to revamp its web presence, NYC.gov. On July 30-31, teams of designers, developers, writers, photographers and product managers will gather at General Assembly in New York City and spend a weekend implementing their visions for a re-imagined NYC.gov. Mayor Michael Bloomberg announced the contest in which “civic participation will meet the digital age.” The idea for community involvement in the city website’s redesign came from the Mayor’s <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/codeforamerica.org/viewer?url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/media/media/PDF/90dayreport.pdf">“Road Map for the Digital City,”</a> published in May.</p>
