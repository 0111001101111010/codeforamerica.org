Code for America's 2014 <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/fellows">Fellowship</a> application closed at midnight last night and we're happy to announce that 658 talented individuals applied for the program. To those of you who applied — thank you so much for your dedication to civic tech. You will be receiving an email from us shortly with next steps.

For those of you who are curious to see who applies for our Fellowship, current fellow <a href="http://about.me/moncef">Moncef Belyamani</a> graciously wrote a Rails app to help us pull some preliminary data:

<strong>WHO APPLIED</strong>

In keeping with our efforts to reach out to groups that are often under-represented, we're happy to say that this year's applicants come from a variety of backgrounds and experiences. Of the 658 applicants who applied to the fellowship program 33 percent identify as female, one percent either don't identify as a specific gender or identify as gender "other", and 50 percent identify as a racial minority. While we know we can always improve our efforts in reaching out to diverse communities, we think this is a step in the right direction. Our goal is to have a Fellowship class that reflects the communities we work with.

<strong>WHAT THEY DO</strong>

In addition to those people considered traditional "coders", our fellowship applicants show a wide range of talents and skills. While 20 percent listed back-end development as their primary skill and 12 percent listed front-end development, we also made an effort to encourage others to apply in order to produce well-rounded teams. Eighteen percent of applicants are researcher / analysts, 17 percent are product / project managers, seven percent are UX / UI designers, and three percent are data scientists.

<strong>COMMON DESCRIPTORS</strong>

This year we asked our fellows to offer up three words that others might use to describe them. Common descriptors included: <em>Creative, Curious, Dedicated, Diligent, Enthusiastic, Focused, Hardworking, Honest, Innovative, Intelligent, Leader, Motivated, Passionate, Reliable, Resourceful,</em> and <em>Smart.</em>

Naturally all of these positive words made us excited to meet everyone. We look forward to next steps with these talented individuals and know that the future ahead will be a bright one.
