<p>Code for America’s 2014 <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/fellows">Fellowship</a> application closed at midnight last night and we’re happy to announce that 658 talented individuals applied for the program. To those of you who applied — thank you so much for your dedication to civic tech. You will be receiving an email from us shortly with next steps.</p>
<p>For those of you who are curious to see who applies for our Fellowship, current fellow <a href="http://about.me/moncef">Moncef Belyamani</a> graciously wrote a Rails app to help us pull some preliminary data:</p>
<p><strong>WHO APPLIED</strong></p>
<p>In keeping with our efforts to reach out to groups that are often under-represented, we’re happy to say that this year’s applicants come from a variety of backgrounds and experiences. Of the 658 applicants who applied to the fellowship program 33 percent identify as female, one percent either don’t identify as a specific gender or identify as gender “other”, and 50 percent identify as a racial minority. While we know we can always improve our efforts in reaching out to diverse communities, we think this is a step in the right direction. Our goal is to have a Fellowship class that reflects the communities we work with.</p>

<p><strong>WHAT THEY DO</strong></p>
<p>In addition to those people considered traditional “coders”, our fellowship applicants show a wide range of talents and skills. While 20 percent listed back-end development as their primary skill and 12 percent listed front-end development, we also made an effort to encourage others to apply in order to produce well-rounded teams. Eighteen percent of applicants are researcher / analysts, 17 percent are product / project managers, seven percent are UX / UI designers, and three percent are data scientists.</p>

<p><strong>COMMON DESCRIPTORS</strong></p>
<p>This year we asked our fellows to offer up three words that others might use to describe them. Common descriptors included: <em>Creative, Curious, Dedicated, Diligent, Enthusiastic, Focused, Hardworking, Honest, Innovative, Intelligent, Leader, Motivated, Passionate, Reliable, Resourceful,</em> and <em>Smart.</em></p>
<p>Naturally all of these positive words made us excited to meet everyone. We look forward to next steps with these talented individuals and know that the future ahead will be a bright one.</p>
