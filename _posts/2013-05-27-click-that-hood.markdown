Click that Hood is a game based on open data, built by Code for America’s 2013 Louisville fellowship team. You pick a city, then get a challenge to identify the polygon of a named neighborhood. The "easy" version offers only a limited number of options; the "hard" version has you selecting from all the neighborhoods. I tried Chicago (where I went to school) and didn't do too badly.

The best thing about this game? There's a blank tile to <a href="https://github.com/codeforamerica/click_that_hood/wiki/How-to-add-a-city-to-Click-That-%E2%80%99Hood">add your own city</a>.

Add your <a href="https://github.com/codeforamerica/click_that_hood/wiki/How-to-add-a-city-to-Click-That-%E2%80%99Hood">city</a>.
