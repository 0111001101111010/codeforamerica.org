<p><img alt="" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-20544" height="216" src="http://codeforamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Screen-Shot-2013-02-27-at-9.33.26-AM-300x216.png" title="Screen Shot 2013-02-27 at 9.33.26 AM" width="300"/>Last weekend over Feb. 22-24, 22 municipalities from coast to coast joined us for our second annual <a href="http://brigade.codeforamerica.org/pages/codeacross">Code Across America</a>.</p>
<p>Events were hosted in each of the nine Code for America 2013 partner communities by the Code for America 2013 fellows. The other events were held by Code for America brigades and allied organizations, many of which also participated in <a href="http://opendataday.org/">International Open Data Day</a>. Activities included hackathons, write-a-thons, unconferences, open data activities, and meetups.</p>
<p>The community generated an impressive number of Github repos, beta apps, liberated datasets, media, and other achievements — we’re still compiling all the resulting projects, so stay tuned to see the full collection. In the meantime, check out <a href="http://storify.com/CivicWhitaker/2013-codeacross">this Storify</a> (put together by our Chicago Brigade captain Christopher Whitaker) for a sampling of what happened over the weekend in the 22 cities that participated. Thanks to all of you who came out to code across America!</p>
