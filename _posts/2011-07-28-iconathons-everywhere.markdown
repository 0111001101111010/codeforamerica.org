<h3>What are the Iconathons?</h3>
Code for America, in partnership with the <a href="http://thenounproject.com">Noun Project</a> is organizing a new initiative to create civic symbols for the public domain, at day-long  design events called "Iconathons." Through facilitated design sessions, participants will generate icons and symbols that visually convey concepts frequently needed in civic design. The aim of Iconathon is to add to the public domain a set of graphic symbols that can be used by both the public and the private sectors to easily communicate universally recognized concepts to city inhabitants.
