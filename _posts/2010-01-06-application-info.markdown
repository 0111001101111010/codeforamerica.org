Thank you for your interest in Code for America!

Please download and read the entire <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/call-for-applications">Call for Applications</a> page before you proceed with the application process.

The application form is seven pages long. We recommend that you collect all of your answers before you fill out the online application, as we don't yet offer the ability to save your work and return. The text of the questions you will be asked in the online form is saved as one <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/application-questions">web page</a>.

Important Dates in the Application Process:

January 1: City application form available
February 1: Deadline for Phase 1 applications from cities
February 15: Selected cities invited to submit Phase 2 applications
March 5: Deadline for Phase 2 applications
