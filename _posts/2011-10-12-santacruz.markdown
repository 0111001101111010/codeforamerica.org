<blockquote>“The interface proposed has a lot in common with TurboTax, simplifying the interface between small business owners and City Hall. We’re using technology to make government more efficient, transparent and easier to work with for small business owners.”<strong>
</strong>

<strong>- Mayor Ryan </strong><strong>Coonerty</strong></blockquote>
For  citizens, acquiring the right permits from their city government can be  confusing -- it’s not always clear which department should be contacted  or what permits are actually required for a project. The process can  frustrate local entrepreneurs, limiting economic development and  stifling local job creation.

The  city of Santa Cruz is seeking to partner with Code for America out of a  shared vision that citizens shouldn’t have to choose between economic  development and policies that protect the natural resources, vibrancy,  and character of their communities. Together, we hope to use technology  to streamline the process.

Most  small business owners typically apply for permits from multiple  agencies. The promise of this project is that it is focused not only on  improving efficiency across agencies, but also in helping small  businesses gain greater visibility and transparency into the permits,  entitlements, time and money required to open a new venture. The hope is  that Code for America can scale the best practices learned in Santa  Cruz to a solution for other California cities that can increase  efficiency, cost-savings, and transparency – while stimulating the local  economy.

Santa  Cruz has been selected as a partner for the 2012 Code for America Fellowship, so starting in January 2012, a team of CfA Fellows will come on board to take on this challenge. To do so, they'll rely on community involvement and support; share your ideas below.
