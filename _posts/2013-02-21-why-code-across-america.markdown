This weekend, in 22 communities throughout country, hundreds of passionate citizens are coming together to <a href="http://brigade.codeforamerica.org/pages/codeacross" target="_blank">Code Across America</a>.
<blockquote>"I'm coding for America because I want to radically alter the relationship between citizens and government."
<em>-- Lt. Governor Gavin Newsom</em></blockquote>
<blockquote>"I code for America because I want innovation to be synonymous with city hall"
<em>-- CfA Accelerator Coordinator Alex Tran</em></blockquote>
See what other dedicated citizens had to say:
