<p>After leaving my position as an associate attorney for a private law firm, I researched going back to my technical roots and reinventing myself as a technologist with an aim to improve society with my technical skills. The reason I had gone to law school and later gone on to become a patent attorney is because I wanted to help champion inventors and creative people by zealously advocating for their creative efforts. As a patent attorney, I greatly enjoyed reading about technology everyday while also being able to use communication and writing skills to navigate the daunting bureaucracy that is the U.S.P.T.O. and the patent law system.</p>
<p>Further, I really enjoy learning new technologies to leverage in developing solutions to complicated technical problems.</p>
<p>The lawyer side of me would really love to learn further about how government works (the experience working with the U.S.P.T.O. whet my appetite), and what inefficiencies lie therein, in an effort to identify elegant solutions to remedy workflow problems in the government. The technologist side of me would really love to learn new technologies and exploit current skills I already possess to apply a technical solution to the problems faced by government. I genuinely believe that technology is an underutilized (and valued) tool in our society, and yet, with a team of talented people, zealous about technology and social change, we can make an impact in improving our country; we can serve our country to improve the lives of everyone. The thought of being part of such a team is very exciting for me. I am glad to be part of an organization that can make such a significant contribution to my country.</p>
