<p>More reasons for open, civic data: “Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine announced last year that they had found a net reduction in crime in areas around more than 4,000 vacant lots that had been “greened” compared with others that were left alone over 10 years.”</p>
