Six months ago, the Fellows came together for its <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/2013/01/31/not-another-hackathon/">first hackathon</a>, and there, we created the initial prototype for <a href="http://streetmix.net/">Streetmix</a>. Since then, we've received so many encouraging responses from users around the world, such as transportation planners in Raleigh, N.C. a community engagement specialist in Vancouver, Canada, and architects and urban designers in Brazil. As a result, we've continued working on Streetmix during <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/labs/">Labs Friday</a> and in whatever free time we could spare during our Fellowship, and already, Streetmix has helped a small community <a href="http://siouxcentercrg.com/">protest against widening highways in Sioux Center, Iowa</a>, visualized <a href="http://urbanabq.com/2013/06/13/central-avenue-the-necessity-of-a-strong-vision-community-champions-and-street-trees/">BRT planning in Albuquerque, N.M.</a>, shined a spotlight on <a href="http://www.seattlebikeblog.com/2013/08/05/city-will-study-improvements-to-notorious-section-of-dexter-between-denny-and-mercer/">bike safety in Seattle</a>, and engaged the public on <a href="http://transportblog.co.nz/2013/07/27/ponsonby-rd-masterplan-released/">streetscape master planning in Aukland, New Zealand</a>. Someone even <a href="http://resma.cl/streetmix/">forked and translated Streetmix into Spanish</a>!

Today, we'd like to announce that Streetmix is now in public beta, with <a href="http://streetmix.net/help/about-beta">a new look and new features we're all very proud of</a>. Check it out!
