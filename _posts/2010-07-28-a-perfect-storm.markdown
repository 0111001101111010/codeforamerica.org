The Center for American Progress released <a href="http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2010/07/dww_millennials.html">a report this week about Millennials' perception of government</a>, calling this generation the "most pro-government." Interestingly, that belief stemmed not from satisfaction in policy but from confidence in reform: Millennials believe that a robust government can and will be smarter, especially if it embraces new information technology.
<blockquote>"The key lesson embedded in these seemingly paradoxical results is that people would rather improve government performance than reduce its size. They are extremely receptive to a reform agenda that would eliminate inefficient government programs, implement performance-based policy decisions, and adopt modern management methods and <strong>information technologies</strong>." (emphasis mine)</blockquote>
This generation wants to keep government at the table, but seated in a desk chair, not a recliner.

This is why I think there's been such great response to the <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/fellows">CfA Fellowship</a> from Millennials. It comes at a time when government needs to change and people believe they can make that happen. It's a perfect storm. We can catalyze increased volunteerism, modern efficiencies, and renewed confidence, all by connecting the dots between the Millennials' desire for service and change and politicians' interest in better government and, well, self-preservation. As the CAP report puts it, Millennials "hold the key to a new era of public confidence in governmentâ€š if public officials learn to spend taxpayers' dollars more carefully, and do what works." In fact, a majority (67%) across generations shared this sentiment. And so in a way, CfAcan offer any city the chance to "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLdA1ikkoEc">ask not</a>," and provide any citizen -- young and old -- an answer.
