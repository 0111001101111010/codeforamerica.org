<p id="internal-source-marker_0.8923981641419232"><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 13px; color: #000000;">Last week, CfA kicked off its summer internship program with two notable visits: DJ Patil, Chief of Product at Color, and Ev Williams and Jason Goldman of Twitter. Both talks offered unique insights about technology, entrepreneurship, and social change. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 13px;"> </span><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 13px;"><a href="http://codeforamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/DJ.jpg"></a><a href="http://codeforamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/DJ.jpg"></a><a href="http://codeforamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/EvandJason_1.jpg"><img alt="" class="alignright" height="217" src="http://codeforamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/EvandJason_1.jpg" title="EvandJason_1" width="323"/></a> <span style="color: #000000;">Patil shared his broad range of experiences in academia, government, and tech — highlighting key lessons and important guideposts for CfA fellows and interns trying to use technology to effect tangible change in government. Williams and Goldman talked briefly about their start-up experiences — at Blogger, Twitter, etc. — and then answered questions from the CfA team about the inner workings of Twitter and advice for the fellowship program. In sum, we came away with useful and interesting ideas to apply to our summer efforts — and some free lunch! </span></span></p>
