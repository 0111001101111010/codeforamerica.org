Yesterday, co-founder of <a href="http://indyhall.org/">Indy Hall</a> Alex Hillman (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/alexknowshtml">@alexknowshtml</a>) wrote up a terrific article about Code for America and its effect on Philadelphia on his blog <em><a href="http://dangerouslyawesome.com/">dangerouslyawesome</a>. </em><em>
</em>

Here's an excerpt of <a href="http://dangerouslyawesome.com/2011/07/a-hall-pass-for-bureaucracy-code-for-america-philadelphia/">"A Hall Pass for Bureaucracy - Code for America Philadelphia"</a>:
<blockquote><em>When I first heard about Code for America, what intrigued me the most was the concept of a “bolt-on” group of individuals who ultimately have to abide by the rules of operating within government and the civic ecosystem, but at the same time, are given a bit of a “hall pass” to move through the layers of bureaucracy... I think that the CFA process helped prime the pumps for the continued development of a new style of trusting relationship between city hall and citizens.</em></blockquote>
Definitely read the whole post, as Alex makes a smart and well-written case for pushing the citizen-government relationship forward. We're thrilled to be a part of it!
