This week, representatives from dozens of countries came together at the United Nations in New York for the <a href="http://OpenGovPartnership.org">Open Government Partnership</a> to discuss shared commitments to making government more <a href="http://civiccommons.org/2011/09/open-data-bringing-down-the-barriers-to-innovation/">transparent</a>, efficient, and participatory. The U.S. published their report, with various commitments to open government, which is available here. More details are available on <a href="http://OpenGovPartnership.org">OpenGovPartnership.org</a>, where updates will be available, but for an overview of the partnership and its mission, check out it's beautiful launch video below.
