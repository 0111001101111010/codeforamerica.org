<p><strong>Pre-field trip:<br/>
</strong>Debate on dress code – Blazers vs. Track Jackets</p>
<p><strong>Travel:</strong><br/>
Muni with clipper card tutorials for the bikers.</p>
<p><strong>SF City Hall <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_City_Hall#cite_note-3" target="_blank">Wiki</a> trivia:<br/>
</strong>Dome is the fifth largest in the world.</p>
<p><strong>Conference room:</strong><br/>
Freezing, fellows glad they had track jackets.</p>
<p><strong>Speakers:</strong><br/>
Steve Kawa – Chief of Staff to Mayor Lee<br/>
Jay Nath – Chief Innovation Officer<br/>
Nancy Alfaro – Director of 311<br/>
Ed Reiskin – Director of Municipal Transportation Agency<br/>
Shannon Spanhake – Analyst on Innovation Team</p>
<p><strong>Notes on speeches:</strong><br/>
The glass is half full. Abundance not Scarcity.<br/>
Customer service!<br/>
311 is not a switch board.<br/>
Bureaucracy doesn’t have to be bad. Is just bogged down in layers of well intentioned rules.<br/>
Thanks to innovation, it is an exciting time to work in city hall.</p>
<p><strong>Notes on the speakers:</strong><br/>
Glad these people exist. City workers need better PR, they are not in it for the fat pension.</p>
<p><strong>Speakers Advice for navigating city hall:</strong><br/>
Be patient. Be patient. Be patient.<br/>
Use their own data to plead your case.<br/>
Not everyone is as technically savvy as you.<br/>
When it comes to tech lots of people are afraid of looking like neophytes.<br/>
Don’t let legacy systems get you down, they are a chance to help.<br/>
When all else fails call in the big guns.</p>
