<p>Part of being a Code for America fellow is sharing the skills you’ve learned with others, which is why I’m excited to announce our <a href="https://github.com/codeforamerica/skillshares" title="skillshares project">skillshares project on Github</a>. Every internal Code for America skillshare from here on out will have its content opened to everyone — allowing those unable to attend to still have the ability and access to learn. Feel free to <a href="https://github.com/codeforamerica/skillshares">watch the project</a> in order to get updates on added tutorials.</p>
<p>One of the first skillshares I’ve contributed to the repository is <a href="https://github.com/codeforamerica/skillshares/tree/master/git_basics">Git Basics</a>. It’s intended to not be an extensive tutorial on Git (<a href="http://git-scm.com/book">there’s tons of those</a> <a href="http://blip.tv/scott-chacon">available already</a>), but more of a set of tips, tricks, and heuristics on workflow for using Git each day. The intent behind it is actually not to be 100 percent textbook accurate in descriptions and explanations, but instead make the content easy-to-remember and give some direction in using Git for your own projects and projects with others.</p>
<p>Hopefully we’ll be able to add other skillshares in the future ranging from design, to open government, to urban planning, to more technology-focused tutorials.</p>
