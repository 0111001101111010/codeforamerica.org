<p>On May 27 this year I received wonderful news: I had been accepted as a Google Summer of Code student at Code for America! That meant that I was going to spend the next three months working on a project whose <a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/project/google/gsoc2013/santiagomunin/79001">idea</a> I had submitted just days before.</p>
<p>My idea was to create a wrapper of the <a href="http://wiki.open311.org/GeoReport_v2">GeoReport API</a> (part of the <a href="http://open311.org/">Open311</a> standard) to make it easier for other users to create applications related to the standard. I elected Java as the programming language for this project because it is the one I know best and it would allow building Android applications too.</p>
<p>Days after, I met my mentor, <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/ycombinator">Shaunak Kashyap</a>, for the first time. We discussed the idea I had proposed deeply and thought about which tools and methodologies we were going to use. He did an awesome job helping me to create the library and improve myself as a software developer. During the summer we met once a week through Google Hangouts to discuss the status of the project and our next steps.</p>
<p>I think we did quite a good job, the result is a fully functional library with some features such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Very simple usage (and easy-to-follow documentation)</li>
<li>Data caching (avoiding a lot of costly network operations)</li>
<li>Logging system</li>
<li>Compatible with some non-standard endpoints</li>
<li><a href="http://codeforamerica.github.io/open311_java/cobertura/index.html">Most of the library is supported by unit tests</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In case you would like to learn more about the library, here are some interesting links:</p>

</ul>
<p>Thanks to Google, Code for America, and (especially) Shaunak for this great experience.</p>
