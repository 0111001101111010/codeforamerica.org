This past cycle, we took a stab at collecting all the Twitter handles for cities and counties in <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/2011/03/30/shortstack-city-and-county-subdomains/">ShortStack</a>, our knowledge base of local governments. Out of 1293 accounts across 810 cities and counties (that we found), here's the top ten by followers:

No surprise that our most populous city, NYC, takes the top spot on the Twitter rankings. But I often think of San Francisco, Chicago and DC as leaders of the Gov 2.0 space. So, its definitely fun to see Oklahoma City and Minneapolis take two of the top ten spots! Two of our 2011 cities, Philadelphia and Seattle also represent. Some of our fellows will be diving into these numbers and researching the cities to understand their success; check back soon for their findings.



To get the list, we wrote some scripts (available in our <a href="https://github.com/codeforamerica/shortstack">github repo</a>) using Google search and our growing database of city and county websites (about 8800 so far). If we couldn't find a link to a twitter account from the city or county website, we probably didn't find it (and most likely, neither did its citizens). We're building towards trending data across all Twitter, Facebook, blogs and other sorts of interesting streams. We'll report back with more in the next month and make the data public. If you'd like a copy of the data, let us know.
