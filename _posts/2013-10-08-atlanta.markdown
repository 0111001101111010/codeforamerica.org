<h4>The Community</h4>
In early 2013, the City of Atlanta partnered with Start Up Atlanta to co-host the city’s first <a href="http://govathon.com/">Govathon</a> or city-wide civic tech hackathon. The effort not only sparked innovation and greater citizen collaboration, but it also released some of the city’s most useful <a href="https://atlanta.demo.socrata.com/">datasets</a>. In addition, the City of Atlanta also established <a href="http://www.atlantaga.gov/index.aspx?page=133">Focus on Results (FOR)</a> Atlanta. A performance focused strategy group that uses data to improve and augment strategic and operational goals across city departments.

As the city moves into its 2014 fellowship year, we hope to support Atlanta’s already strong tech community and increase available data sets and community participation.
