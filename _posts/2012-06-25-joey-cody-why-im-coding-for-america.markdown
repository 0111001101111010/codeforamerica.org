Code for America is hands down the best open-source organization for changing things today. The government is in dire need of going from web 1.0 to web 3.0 to better engage and interact with citizens. As Iâ€™ve seen Code for America recognizes and acts to make that change happen.

I'm a fourth year Computer Science with Computational Economics Emphasis major at UCSB and I'm just getting settled into Code for America as a developer intern.

This summer I intend to put my skills to the test to develop tools for civic hackers across the U.S. Code for America has had many projects that have been hugely successful in local governments. Things like Open311, Brigade, and Adopt-a-Hydrant are actively changing the way citizens participate in their government.

But this is just the start. Government needs to be a transparent and collaborative process.

I Code for America to develop these tools that will help make this possible. It will be a long process that will last well beyond this summer. But I intend to see my projects to completion. With the help of the CfA fellows and civic hackers everywhere we will change the way government interacts with people.
