Nominate them for the <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/fellows">2012 Code for America Fellowship</a>. We're gearing up for the launch of the 2012 fellowship application, but in the meantime, we wanted to open it up for <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/fellows/nominate">nominations</a>. Your recommendation not only can encourage them to apply, but will also be considered during our competitive review process. Tell us who you think would make a great fellow and why using the form below.



<strong>Plus, if you're going to SxSW and you nominate someone before March 9, we'll even get you a <a href="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4120/4740102349_f09014b375.jpg">free CfA t-shirt</a>, hand-delivered at the event.</strong> Just indicate that you're going on the nomination form, and we'll follow up with more details. Hurry, though, there are only so many we can fit into our suitcase.
