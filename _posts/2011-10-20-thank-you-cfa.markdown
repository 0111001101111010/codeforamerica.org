<p>I’m stepping out of Code for America at the end of the year. It’s time for some new leadership to continue building the CfA network effect.</p>
<p>It’s been a little over a year and half since I got involved in the Code for America story. I was hacking government in the Midwest when I heard about the birth of a new type of public service that paired geeks with cities to solve all kinds of problems with a lean startup mentality. After a few years of battling to get ‘the datas’ paid for by my tax dollars, I knew I wanted to get involved, even if it meant doing dishes. Government needs transformative change, I saw CfA as a place to do it.</p>
<p>I started following the blog as soon as it launched, and sent my hat in the ring when Jen posted the need for a CTO. At that time, CfA had raised maybe $25 to $50k, not near enough to support her, much less me and an army of geeks. Two months later, Jen had raised nearly $1million and said, ‘when can you start?’ For an organization to go from birth to adolescence in such a short time is a testament not only to the need for CfA but to Jen’s leadership.</p>
<p>I’ll be writing some thoughts here about the year as we close out the first fellowship cycle. For now, we’re looking at bringing on a <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/jobs/">technology lead</a> and a new CTO to complement our amazing new fellowship program director, Bob Sofman. The organization is in great hands and I’ve had a blast helping Jen and team build iteration one of Code for America. I’ll still hang around in an advisory capacity and look forward to watching iteration two launch next year.</p>
<p>I plan to step out at the end of the year (Dec 31), work on my vitamin D levels at the beach, and then head back into the private sector working on government technology. Stay tuned!</p>
