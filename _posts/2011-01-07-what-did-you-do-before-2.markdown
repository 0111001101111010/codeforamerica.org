There was a great moment yesterday when <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/venturehacks/the-lean-startup-2">Eric Ries</a> asked the fellows, “what were your roles before you came to Code for America? How many of you were programmers? Designers? Project managers?” Hands went up and down as our teams displayed their backgrounds, with many folks raising their hands more than once, reflecting their diversity of experience.  Eric said, “Okay, so that’s what you were before,” and I foolishly chimed in “Hey, they’re still doing those things here!”

Silly me. Of course the fellows will still be coding and designing.  But of all people, I should have seen where Eric was going with this. Code for America is in many ways a misnomer, implying to some that code alone, or software alone, or technology alone, or even agile processes alone can effect change.

“Whatever your role was before, you are now an entrepreneur.  Which means that your job is now to do whatever it takes.”  Exactly. An entrepreneur, an advocate, a change agent, a persuader, a data wrangler, a researcher, a documenter, a storyteller.  Code for America isn’t about parachuting smarty-pants programmers into a bureaucracy; it’s about tapping that passion for making things better in people with skills that can help.  The idea is to train, coach, and support our fellows to be able to have a broader impact. And after the first two days of the program, I know that this first class has the skills and motivation they’ll need.
