Last Thursday, Pete Fecteau took the stage at Ignite Philly 7 on behalf of Team Philadelphia to talk about CfA, why he's participating, and what we're hoping to accomplish in the city. His Ignite, titled "The Dumbest Person in the Room", really got people thinking and the team was able to talk to a lot of people afterwards that have honest interest in the Code for America program. Pete's ignite was even chosen as "Honorable Mention" for best overall ignite.
