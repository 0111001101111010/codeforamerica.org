This weekend Code for America communities throughout the country are coming together to participate in the second annual <a href="http://brigade.codeforamerica.org/pages/codeacross">Code Across America</a>.

Code Across America is a multi-day event that any person, municipality, or community can join, big or small, beginner or expert. Individuals and groups can Code Across America through virtual and in-person activities around the country.

The idea for Code Across started in 2011 when teams of Fellows hosted community events while they were living in and exploring their partner cities. Hackathons and the like were great at sharing the “Code for America effect” with local communities and connecting them with local government. In 2012, we carried on the tradition and booted up the Brigade at the same time when we organized the<a href="http://codeforamerica.org/code-across-america-2012"> first Code Across America</a> in 16 cities, eight in Fellowship cities and eight in the first ever Brigades cities.

In 2013 we’re Coding Across America again! Join us:
<ul>
	<li><strong>WHO:</strong> Urbanists, civic hackers, city and county officials, developers, designers, and anyone with the passion and motivation to collaborate with their local government</li>
