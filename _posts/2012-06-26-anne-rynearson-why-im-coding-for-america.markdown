<p>My favorite childhood story was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Miss-Rumphius-Barbara-Cooney/dp/0140505393">Miss Rumphius</a>. Miss Rumphius sets out to do three things in her life: travel the world, live by the ocean, and make the world a more beautiful place. Like Miss Rumphius in the story, I’ve found that the goal of making the world a more beautiful place can be a challenge.</p>
<p>My background is in education reform. I’ve spent time in the classroom, in a teachers’ union, and in the Department of Education. And at every level, I’ve seen the same phenomenon: people facing sclerotic bureaucracy that saps them of their energy and keeps their creative ideas from doing good. Enter Code for America.</p>
<p>To me, Code for America isn’t really about coding. Though apps like <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/?cfa_project=wheres-my-school-bus">Where’s My School Bus</a> and <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/2011/07/13/solar-widget">Solar Widget</a> are cool, such technology is merely a means to an end (full disclosure: this is a thought I’ve heard from many during my first week at Code for America). The true power of Code for America comes from its ability to influence the culture of governments. Or, more specifically, to influence the way that people in government think.</p>
<p>Code for America fellows embrace the tech-world mentality: feedback loops, iteration, and – most of all – an endless faith in the possible. Bringing such energy to the crowded corridors and cramped offices of city hall exposes local government to a new way of doing things. And when bureaucrats begin to embrace the “why not?” mentality of the technology world, real and lasting improvements in government can begin.</p>
<p>Like Miss Rumphius, I want to make the world a more beautiful place. I’m coding for America because I believe the organization will help create a culture of efficiency, openness, and collaboration in city government. That would be a more beautiful world indeed.</p>
