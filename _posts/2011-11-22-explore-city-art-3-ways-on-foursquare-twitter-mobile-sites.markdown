<p>Above, see the team Google+ Hangout photo shoot.</p>
<p>The two hip dudes holding the heart? That’s Michael Ellsworth and Corey Gutch, the dynamic design team duo from the Seattle creative agency <a href="http://www.dumbeyes.com/">Dumb Eyes</a> who also help to run Seattle’s <a href="http://seattleartwalks.org/">monthly art walks</a>.</p>
<p>The refined, bearded gentleman? That’s Matt Blair, the culture-loving smartphone developer from Portland who created <a href="http://publicartpdx.com/">Portland’s first public art app</a> that launched last April.</p>
<p>The two with the toothy grins? That’s me and John Mertens at Code for America’s offices in San Francisco.</p>
<p>Together over the course of the last six months, our team collaborated with developers, designers, residents, and city staff from Portland, Seattle, San Francisco, Philadelphia, and Boston, and county staff from King County, Washington, to help make public and street art more discoverable in cities. Today we are proud to announce three new ways to explore art in these five cities. Including:</p>
<p><strong>1. Foursquare.</strong><br/>
In four cities — Boston, Philadelphia, Seattle, and San Francisco — you are now able to check in, comment, and explore nearly 3,000 pieces of public art.</p>
<p><strong>2. Twitter.</strong><br/>
Anywhere you go, if you find street art or public art, you can Tweet a geo-located image at @publicartapp and help map it. The results appear at <a href="http://artmapper.org">artmapper.org.</a></p>
<p>This app, developed by John with help from civic hacker Mark Headd, is currently a part of an art exhibit, “Here Be Dragons: Mapping Information and Imagination,” at the <a href="http://www.theintersection.org/calendar/index.php?op=view&amp;id=4280">Intersection for the Arts in San Francisco</a>, and won honorable mention for the first annual <a href="http://www.summerofsmart.org/about/">Summer of Smart hackathon</a>. The technology was also used in <a href="http://www.summerofsmart.org/projects/public-art-spaces-2/">Public Art Spaces</a>, an award-winning app from the same competition that enables the public to tag spaces in cities where they would like to see public art.</p>
<p><strong>3. One smartphone app, and five city-specific mobile websites help you to find public art near you:<br/>
</strong><em>(Design by the Dumb Eyes team; meant for display on smartphones.)</em></p>
<p>In Boston, <a href="http://bos.publicartapp.mobi">http://bos.publicartapp.mobi</a><br/>
In Seattle, <a href="http://sea.publicartapp.mobi">http://sea.publicartapp.mobi</a><br/>
In San Francisco, <a href="http://sf.publicartapp.mobi">http://sf.publicartapp.mobi</a><br/>
In Philadelphia, <a href="http://phl.publicartapp.mobi">http://phl.publicartapp.mobi</a><br/>
In Portland, go to <a href="http://publicartpdx.com/">Public Art PDX</a> to download an app for iPod, iPad or iTouch.</p>
<p>In all of these cities, we also published the location data and other details for public art in a machine-readable format for anyone to use. We look forward to seeing other inspired developers mix and mash this data up and create new apps that help people interact and explore the history and culture that capture the spirit of these cities.</p>
