title: Have Spare Office Supplies?

excerpt: Code for America is agonizingly close to confirming our office space for
  2011. Regardless of the location, however, there are some things we know we'll need
  toget up and running in the space, and we also know that we won't have much time
  or resources to make that happen. 20 fellows are coming on board in under two months.
  That's why we're asking for your help. If you or your company has any office supplies
  on hand and are looking to help a worthy cause, please consider donating to Code
  for America. A starter list of what we'll need is below, but if there's something
  you have you think we could use -- a ping pong table? an old Atari? -- don't hesitate
  to let us know.

<ul>
	<li><strong>Office chairs.</strong> We have <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/2010/11/01/2011-cfa-fellows">20 Fellows</a> coming on board, and 6 staff members. Ideally, we'd like 26 of the same type of comfortable chairs... we'll be working long hours!</li>
	<li><strong>Monitors, keyboards, and power cords.</strong> With a dynamic space and a month of traveling,we're expecting everyone will be carrying around their laptops, but it'd be good to have a way for everyone to sit down with a monitor and keyboard and get some work done. If you have lots, a couple, or even just one to spare, do let us know; we'd love to have 26 sets.</li>
	<li><strong>LCD Projector, Screen.</strong> Education is a big part of our Fellowship program. We'll be bringing in technology and government leaders to speak and present to our Fellows throughout the year. If you have either an LCD Projector or screen (or both!) contact us.</li>
	<li><strong>Copier, scanner:</strong> it can be an all-in-one, or two discreet machines.</li>
	<li><strong>Couches, lounge chairs.</strong> We'll have a welcome area, as well as a lounge in either of the spaces we're considering. We can mix and match, so if you have any spare couches or lounge chairs please let us know.</li>
	<li><strong>Desk phones, speaker phones.</strong> We'll have a conference room and will require one high-quality speaker phone; we also will need 10-12 desk phones.</li>
	<li><strong>Cafe tables and chairs.</strong> We'll need some number of tables and chairs in our kitchen area or lounge; matching would be nice but if you have any please let us know.</li>
	<li><strong>Bean bag chairs.</strong> Why not, everyone loves bean bag chairs!</li>
</ul>
Please contact us at info@codeforamerica.org if you think you might be able to help us get our space well outfitted in 2011. If you can send a picture along with your email, that would be great. We're hoping to be in our space by December 1, 2010, so we'll be able to begin accepting donations at that point. Thanks so much!
