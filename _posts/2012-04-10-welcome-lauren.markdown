<p>Code for America is pleased to welcome <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/lauren-dyson/a/2ab/3">Lauren Dyson</a> as its newest employee. Lauren joins Code for America as the Community Coordinator for our Civic Commons project.</p>
<p>Lauren isn’t new to Code for America, having previously served as a communications intern in 2011, and we’re thrilled to have her back to help develop the community around the Commons.</p>
<p><a href="http://civiccommons.org/">Civic Commons</a> is central to the core mission of Code for America – helping cities work smarter and more efficiently by leveraging the power of the web. The Civic Commons Marketplace and <a href="http://wiki.civiccommons.org/">Wiki</a> provide an invaluable resource to governments to share “what’s working, where” from both the software and policy worlds. The continued development of the community around Civic Commons will be a critical element to its success.</p>
<p>Lauren is a Vassar graduate with experience as an analyst for the Berkman Center for the Internet, and the Congressional Internet Caucus. Her experience and skills will be a huge asset to Code for America on the Civic Commons project.</p>
<p>Please join us in welcoming Lauren to her new position!</p>
