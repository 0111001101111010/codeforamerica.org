<p>A few weeks ago, I had the opportunity to sit down with one of our 2011 Fellows, Mjumbe Poe and talk about life, technology and Code for America. I did a <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/2011/04/14/karla-video/">video about Karla Macedo</a>, another fellow, a few months ago, and getting to know each of these fellows better, and share their perspective is one of my favorite things to do. In my conversation with Mjumbe, it became clear that he has always been fascinated by technology and that he is deeply optimistic about its potential to transform society. But donâ€™t take it from me. Hear what he has to say:</p>

<p>If you share his passion for technology and making society better, consider the <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/fellows">2012 Fellowship</a>; <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/apply">applications are due July 31, 2011</a>.</p>
