<p dir="ltr">Code for America's second <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/accelerator-2013/"> Accelerator</a> year kicked off yesterday. The first day’s schedule was packed with a day-long facilitation session led by Allen “Gunner” from Aspiration Tech. The day’s highlights included: product pitches, breakout sessions, company q&amp;a’s, and a lunch discussion with Tim O’Reilly.</p>

What better way to celebrate the end of a long work day, than in typical CfA style, with snacks and mingling around the kegerator? The night’s mixer was well attended by all branches of the CfA family tree--staff, 2013 fellows, and incubator companies all stopped by to chat with the Accelerator companies.

“<em>Where are the cops</em>?”, a staff member asked excitedly, while scanning the room. She was of course referring to the founders of <a href="http://streetcredsoftware.com/">StreetCred Software</a>, who by day are two police officers from Texas.

Everyone was in good spirits as the different teams zipped up their track jackets and posed for pictures. Sarayu from <a href="http://www.familyassessmentform.com/">FAF</a> struck some model poses while those from <a href="http://archivesocial.com/">ArchiveSocial</a> ducked into the bathroom to do some hurried preening.
It’s already quite apparent how much energy this year’s Accelerator class will bring to our space. Welcome everyone--we’re thrilled you’ve joined the family!
