<p dir="ltr">Code for America’s second <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/accelerator-2013/"> Accelerator</a> year kicked off yesterday. The first day’s schedule was packed with a day-long facilitation session led by Allen “Gunner” from Aspiration Tech. The day’s highlights included: product pitches, breakout sessions, company q&amp;a’s, and a lunch discussion with Tim O’Reilly.</p>
<p>What better way to celebrate the end of a long work day, than in typical CfA style, with snacks and mingling around the kegerator? The night’s mixer was well attended by all branches of the CfA family tree–staff, 2013 fellows, and incubator companies all stopped by to chat with the Accelerator companies.</p>
<p>“<em>Where are the cops</em>?”, a staff member asked excitedly, while scanning the room. She was of course referring to the founders of <a href="http://streetcredsoftware.com/">StreetCred Software</a>, who by day are two police officers from Texas.</p>
<p>Everyone was in good spirits as the different teams zipped up their track jackets and posed for pictures. Sarayu from <a href="http://www.familyassessmentform.com/">FAF</a> struck some model poses while those from <a href="http://archivesocial.com/">ArchiveSocial</a> ducked into the bathroom to do some hurried preening.<br/>
It’s already quite apparent how much energy this year’s Accelerator class will bring to our space. Welcome everyone–we’re thrilled you’ve joined the family!</p>
