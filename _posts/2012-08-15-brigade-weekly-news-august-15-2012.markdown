<h3>Headlines</h3>
<p>This week we tuned into a video about app for fruit gleaning, read about crowd-funding civic projects, talked to cool folks about a national civic hack day, and found out about a new public process for drafting open data legislation in Pittsburgh, PA.</p>
<h3>1. <a data-bitly-type="bitly_hover_card" href="https://sites.google.com/site/pghopendataleg/" target="_blank">Pittsburgh Open Data Legislation Wiki</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://groups.google.com/a/codeforamerica.org/forum/#!forum/pittsburgh-brigade" title="Brigade Google group">Code for Pittsburgh Brigade</a> Member Bob Gradek reported on the local Brigade forum that “Councilman Ricky Burgess (District 9) has introduced Open Data legislation in Pittsburgh City Council. His staff welcomes comment on the <a data-bitly-type="bitly_hover_card" href="https://sites.google.com/site/pghopendataleg/draft-legislation-wiki">draft</a>, which will be up for discussion in September following council recess.” Bob created and manages <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/pghopendataleg/home" title="PGH Open Data Catalog Wiki">a wiki</a> where related information is curated.</p>
<h3>2. <a data-bitly-type="bitly_hover_card" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2ZD0iR-hbk&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">Youth Radio’s ForageCity App – YouTube</a></h3>
<p><a href="http://www.youthradio.org/" title="Youth Radio home">Youth Radio</a> in Oakland, CA posted a tight, brief video explaining how their app works to redistribute excess fruit that otherwise goes to waste. There is a great opportunity to connect this with <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=fruit%20gleaning" title="Google search for fruit gleaning">fruit gleaning</a> programs throughout the country. Check out <a href="http://commons.codeforamerica.org/apps/forage-city" title="Commons page for Forage City">Forage City in Commons</a>. <a href="http://brigade.codeforamerica.org/pages/apps" title="Brigade apps activity page">Let us know if you want to deploy it</a> where you live.</p>
<h3>3. <a href="http://www.ethanzuckerman.com/blog/2012/08/10/how-do-we-make-civic-crowdfunding-awesome/" title="Ethan Zuckerman's blog post">How do we make civic crowdfunding awesome?</a></h3>
<p>Crowd-funding civic hacking is something in which we are most interested at Code for America and in the Brigade, specifically. We’ve seen several crowd-funding startups come and <a href="http://www.civicsponsor.org/" title="civicsponsor.org">go</a>. We’ve seen <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/2012/05/03/kickstarting-art-around-creating-a-community-of-curators/" title="Art Around Kickstarter post on CfA blog">one</a> or two civic projects not reach their crowd-funding goals. The renowned <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethan_Zuckerman" title="Ethan's wiki page">Ethan Zuckerman</a> shared his insights into why some efforts fail and what others should do to succeed.</p>
<h3>4. <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/228865951/transit-app-for-ios-6-and-beyond" title="OpenPlans' Kickstarter for a transit app">Transit App for iOS 6 and Beyond</a></h3>
<p>Speaking of crowd-funded civic projects: <a href="http://www.openplans.org" title="Open Plans' web site">Open Plans</a> is $10K away from their $25K Kickstarter to both keep and improve transit directions on the iPhone. Go Open Plans, go! Help them out, won’t you?</p>
<h3>5. <a href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/vote/4382" title="SWSX panel picker">National Civic Hack Day: Build a Better Government</a></h3>
<p>On Monday I spoke with folks from <a href="http://open.nasa.gov/" title="NASA Open">NASA</a>, <a href="http://www.rhok.org/" title="RHoK home">Random Hacks of Kindess</a>, and <a href="http://secondmuse.com/" title="Second Muse home">Second Muse</a> about creating a National Civic Hack Day. Read about the panel proposed for SXSWi to spread the word.</p>
