<h3>Headlines</h3>
This week we tuned into a video about app for fruit gleaning, read about crowd-funding civic projects, talked to cool folks about a national civic hack day, and found out about a new public process for drafting open data legislation in Pittsburgh, PA.
<h3>1. <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/pghopendataleg/" target="_blank" data-bitly-type="bitly_hover_card">Pittsburgh Open Data Legislation Wiki</a></h3>
<a title="Brigade Google group" href="https://groups.google.com/a/codeforamerica.org/forum/#!forum/pittsburgh-brigade">Code for Pittsburgh Brigade</a> Member Bob Gradek reported on the local Brigade forum that "Councilman Ricky Burgess (District 9) has introduced Open Data legislation in Pittsburgh City Council. His staff welcomes comment on the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/pghopendataleg/draft-legislation-wiki" data-bitly-type="bitly_hover_card">draft</a>, which will be up for discussion in September following council recess." Bob created and manages <a title="PGH Open Data Catalog Wiki" href="https://sites.google.com/site/pghopendataleg/home">a wiki</a> where related information is curated.
<h3>2. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2ZD0iR-hbk&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank" data-bitly-type="bitly_hover_card">Youth Radio's ForageCity App - YouTube</a></h3>
<a title="Youth Radio home" href="http://www.youthradio.org/">Youth Radio</a> in Oakland, CA posted a tight, brief video explaining how their app works to redistribute excess fruit that otherwise goes to waste. There is a great opportunity to connect this with <a title="Google search for fruit gleaning" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=fruit%20gleaning">fruit gleaning</a> programs throughout the country. Check out <a title="Commons page for Forage City" href="http://commons.codeforamerica.org/apps/forage-city">Forage City in Commons</a>. <a title="Brigade apps activity page" href="http://brigade.codeforamerica.org/pages/apps">Let us know if you want to deploy it</a> where you live.
<h3>3. <a title="Ethan Zuckerman's blog post" href="http://www.ethanzuckerman.com/blog/2012/08/10/how-do-we-make-civic-crowdfunding-awesome/">How do we make civic crowdfunding awesome?</a></h3>
Crowd-funding civic hacking is something in which we are most interested at Code for America and in the Brigade, specifically. We've seen several crowd-funding startups come and <a title="civicsponsor.org" href="http://www.civicsponsor.org/">go</a>. We've seen <a title="Art Around Kickstarter post on CfA blog" href="http://codeforamerica.org/2012/05/03/kickstarting-art-around-creating-a-community-of-curators/">one</a> or two civic projects not reach their crowd-funding goals. The renowned <a title="Ethan's wiki page" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethan_Zuckerman">Ethan Zuckerman</a> shared his insights into why some efforts fail and what others should do to succeed.
<h3>4. <a title="OpenPlans' Kickstarter for a transit app" href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/228865951/transit-app-for-ios-6-and-beyond">Transit App for iOS 6 and Beyond</a></h3>
Speaking of crowd-funded civic projects: <a title="Open Plans' web site" href="http://www.openplans.org">Open Plans</a> is $10K away from their $25K Kickstarter to both keep and improve transit directions on the iPhone. Go Open Plans, go! Help them out, won't you?
<h3>5. <a title="SWSX panel picker" href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/vote/4382">National Civic Hack Day: Build a Better Government</a></h3>
On Monday I spoke with folks from <a title="NASA Open" href="http://open.nasa.gov/">NASA</a>, <a title="RHoK home" href="http://www.rhok.org/">Random Hacks of Kindess</a>, and <a title="Second Muse home" href="http://secondmuse.com/">Second Muse</a> about creating a National Civic Hack Day. Read about the panel proposed for SXSWi to spread the word.
<h3>6. <a title="Eventbrite" href="http://cfa2012webinar.eventbrite.com/">Code for America 2012 Fellowship Projects: Demo Webinar</a></h3>
Get to know the apps our 2012 Fellows built for their cities during this 1 hour webinar. All of the apps are <a title="CfA GitHub" href="https://github.com/codeforamerica/">all open source</a>!
