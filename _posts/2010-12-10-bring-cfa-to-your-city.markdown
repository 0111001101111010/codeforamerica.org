<p>Code for America began with a casual conversation between our Founder, Jennifer Pahlka, and Andrew Greenhill, Chief of Staff in Tucson, Arizona. That conversation launched a growing organization that is striving to help the brightest minds of the Web 2.0 generation transform city governments. Conversations matter. We believe that each conversation you have about CfA can strengthen our efforts and help spread our movement across the country. We are now <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/cities/interested-city">accepting applications from local governments</a> to participate in our 2012 program, and you can help connect Code for America with your city government just by getting in touch with your local officials and talking with your friends. That’s why we’ve created the <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/cities/citizen-action-center"><strong>Citizen Action Center</strong></a> to provide you with some ways to make those conversations both easier and more viral:</p>

<p>The <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/cities/citizen-action-center"><strong>Citizen Action Center</strong></a> features some simple tools — email templates, social media tips, a real-time map, and reference materials — to help you get attention and make some noise. Consider it our take on a modern letter writing campaign. With a bit of work, passion, and energy, anyone and everyone can help their city Code for America.</p>
