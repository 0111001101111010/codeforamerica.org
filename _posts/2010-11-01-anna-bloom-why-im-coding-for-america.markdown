<p>Increased access to Internet applications and platforms are empowering citizens to speak more directly with each other and with the government. In the past year, the adoption of these technologies has allowed us to see the unrest following the elections in Iran, enabled the Red Cross to raise millions of dollars for Haiti and helped beachcombers to document the effects of an oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
<p>I am a lover of cities and a journalist who is excited about the possibilities of the Web. After working on a number of citizen journalism projects Code for America feels like the logical next step. I see the program as an incredible opportunity to help shape communication and interaction online between citizens and the government so that it is more open, direct and useful.</p>
