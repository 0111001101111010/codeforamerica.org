<p>After  college, I took an internship in the urban planning department of a  mid-sized, U.S. city.  I was excited to learn about the practice of  urban planning and to see from the inside how cities continue to  evolve.  Urban planning, to me, seemed an important profession and a likely direction for my own career. But after six months of painstaking  progress on a waterfront renewal project (punctuated by constant  speculation about the ongoing FBI investigation in City Hall), I  decided that public service was too slow and too bureaucratic for me.  Instead, I landed in the fast-paced world of  web application development, where I’ve worked for the  past 10 years.</p>
<p>During  my time developing web apps, I’ve witnessed tremendous innovation in  the industry: web servers have been “<a href="http://www.citrix.com/English/ps2/products/feature.asp?contentID=2300351" target="_blank">virtualized</a>” and can now be paid  for by the hour; low-level integration tasks have been automated by sophisticated frameworks like <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/" target="_blank">Ruby on Rails</a>; the open source  community provides an ever-expanding universe of freely-available source code  and tools.  In addition, management protocols carried over from  engineering and manufacturing have been replaced by Agile methodologies like <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/" target="_blank">XP</a> and <a href="http://www.scrumalliance.org/pages/what_is_scrum" target="_blank">Scrum</a>, which are better-suited to the  iterative nature of rapid prototyping and development. These  advancements allow modern web developers to build entire sites (and also <a href="http://sf.theleanstartupmachine.com/" target="_blank">companies</a>) virtually overnight, and to do so without the need for massive rounds of  funding.  As <a href="http://ycombinator.com/" target="_blank">Y Combinator</a> founder, Paul Graham, puts it: “When starting  a start-up was expensive, you had to get the permission of investors to  do it. Now the only threshold is courage.”</p>
<p>It’s  an exciting time to be working in software development, and yet — as  one of the first Code for America Fellows — I find myself contemplating  a return to the public sector.  What would prompt me to make such a  move? My reasons are summed up in Code for America’s own mission  statement: to help city governments become more open, efficient  and interactive by leveraging the tools and technologies of web 2.0.</p>
<p>It  seems to me that the economic crisis gives elected officials a mandate  to go beyond the status quo. Citizens feel a similar responsibility and  are engaging in the civic process in new and meaningful ways. I believe  that the Internet provides a perfect platform for this kind of dialog  and that the potential for innovative gov 2.0 apps is limitless. It may be an exciting time in the private sector, but it’s an  exciting time to be working in the public sector, too!</p>
<p>Tocqueville  said that America’s greatness lies “not in being more enlightened than  any other nation, but rather in her ability to repair her faults.”  To  me, that sounds like the description of any good start-up company:  wasn’t America a “disruptive technology” when it launched?  Doesn’t it  have a solid value proposition and a loyal customer base?  Hasn’t it  refined its mission statement along the way?</p>
<p>Maybe  a new dose of start-up culture is exactly what U.S. cities need.  Maybe as Code for America advances its work, more lights will be on in City Hall at night and  more ramen noodle bowls will be on desks in the morning.  Maybe the Next Big Thing will come from City Hall instead of Silicon Valley.  And  perhaps, as a result, citizens will find new ways to engage in this  critical phase of American history.</p>
