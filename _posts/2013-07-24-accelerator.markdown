<h3>The Accelerator</h3>
This four month program (Jul-Nov) provides civic startups with the network and training to grow their businesses.  In past years, startups have received 100+ hours of mentorship from industry leaders, pitched to hundreads of government officials and gained access to numerous civic tech investors and sales leads.

And we encourage female and minority founded startups to apply.
