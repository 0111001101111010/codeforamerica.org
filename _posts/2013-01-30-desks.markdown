Need a desk and some office space with wifi, snacks, good people, and the occasional ping pong game? Code for America has desks available to rent.

Code for America is located in the historic Storek building (<a href="https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msid=201505176110142059443.0004d6bd9094ef3f9f5b9&amp;msa=0&amp;ll=37.775583,-122.413895&amp;spn=0.009735,0.022187">155 9th St</a>) in the fast-growing mid-Market area of San Francisco -- a central location with great access to public transportation and the startup community. We are located just blocks from Twitter and Heroku, and happily include <a href="http://sparked.com/">Sparked</a>, <a href="http://localdata.com/">Amplify Labs</a>, <a href="http://civicindustries.com/">Civic Industries</a>, <a href="http://www.textizen.com/welcome">Textizen</a>, <a href="http://mapbox.com/">MapBox</a>, <a href="https://electnext.com/">ElectNext</a>, <a href="https://recovers.org/">Recovers.org</a>Â and <a href="http://editorially.com/">Editorially</a> as current tenants.

We're looking for other companies who'd be a great part of our geeky, creative, social community. Beyond our fellows, staff, and other renters, CfA is the "office away from the office" for many civic-minded visitors to the Bay Area.
