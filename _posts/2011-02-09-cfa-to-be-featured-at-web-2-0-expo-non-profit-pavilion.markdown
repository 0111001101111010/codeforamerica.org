Code for America is honored to be <a href="http://blog.web2expo.com/2011/02/announcing-the-w2e-non-profit-pavilion-participants/">selected to be featured in the Nonprofit Pavilion</a> at this year's <a href="http://blog.web2expo.com/">Web 2.0 Expo</a> in San Francisco. A committee of Web 2.0 Expo influencers selected the following nonprofits based on how each uses Web 2.0 tools and technologies in their work. As a participant, CfA will be given a booth as well as outreach opportunities at the event and online. We think this is a great opportunity to connect with other leaders in the Web 2.0 industry, and we're particularly pleased to be selected along with the impressive list of participants: 

<ul>

	<li>ACLU of Northern California</li>

	<li>DonorsChoose.org</li>

	<li>Grist.org</li>

	<li>I’m Too Young for This! Cancer Foundation</li>

	<li>Internet Systems Consortium</li>

	<li>The Linux Fund</li>

	<li>The SETI Institute</li>

	<li>ISIS</li>

	<li>Startup Weekend</li>

</ul>

Hosted by O’Reilly Media, Inc. and UBM TechWeb, this year's Web 2.0 Expo focuses on “Unlocking the Digital Economy,” helping businesses prosper from their ideas in 2011 and is taking place March 28–31, 2011 at Moscone West in San Francisco. We look forward to seeing some of you there!
