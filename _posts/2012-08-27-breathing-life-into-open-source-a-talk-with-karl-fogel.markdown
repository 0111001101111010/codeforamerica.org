All of the code we write at Code for America is <a href="https://github.com/codeforamerica/cfa_template/blob/master/LICENSE.mkd">open source</a>. And in our second year, we’re increasingly looking toward how to grow vibrant, dynamic developer communities around this principle. I spoke with <a href="http://www.red-bean.com/kfogel/">Karl Fogel</a>, open source software developer, copyright reform activist, and the author of <em><a href="http://producingoss.com/">Producing Open Source Software: How to Run a Successful Free Software Project</a></em>. It's a book about the human side of open source development: how successful projects operate, the expectations of users and developers, and the culture of free software. Herewith are five of his tips:

<strong>1. Put your code on GitHub, and make sure it has <a href="http://wiki.civiccommons.org/Choosing_a_License">the right license</a>.</strong>

<strong>2. Set up an email list</strong>
Or anything where people can ask questions of original developers and — equally importantly — each other. Make sure it has public archives. Google Groups is one place to do this.

<strong>3. Include a “Contact Us”</strong>
Include a prominent Contact Us so that every visit sends this message: “If you're interested in using or contributing, come join the community.” For numbers 2 and 3, make sure this is something that signals there are real people here. A common problem, says Fogel, is "not starting out with populated bug tracker. This is easily remedied — you'll have bugs at launch. Seed it with those. It adds transparency so users know that developers are aware of and working on deficiencies.”

<strong>4. Keep logs</strong>
What do people want to know as they read about and use your project? Logs of project website searches and activity can give useful insights. Some examples: what FAQ items are most frequently accessed? Which documentation pages? Which bug reports? Making the [privacy redacted] logs open also “allows the community to correlate those things with discussion forum activity and other publicly-available resources,” says Fogel.

With great logs comes great responsibility: only keep and analyze logs in a way that treats users’ privacy with respect, and make sure to clearly communicate how you use those logs.

<strong>5. Make users a first-class citizen of your [developer] community.</strong>
Coming from a user experience background, this one warms my heart. Karl says, “Users are a first-class citizen of the community. Especially initially, there’s no need to distinguish between the dev list and the user list. As the project goes, you’ll want to split out user forums from dev forums, because the non-early-adopter users don’t want to hear all that dev noise (and vice versa). In that case, make sure some devs stay on the users list — even have a formal rotation to ensure that if necessary.”

If you’d like to learn more about choosing a license, or choosing or configuring discussion forum software, check out the <a href="http://wiki.civiccommons.org/Open_Source_Development_Guidelines">Open Source Development Guidelines</a> from the CfA Commons. For our part, we'll be putting his tips to work by building out <a href="http://www.textizen.com">Textizen</a>'s user forum in the coming weeks.
