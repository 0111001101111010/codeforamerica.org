<img src="http://codeforamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/lessig1.jpeg" alt="" title="lessig" width="250" class="alignright size-full wp-image-3880" />In his 1999 book <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Code-Other-Cyberspace-Lawrence-Lessig/dp/0465039138">Code and Other Laws of Cyberspace</a></em>, Lawrence Lessig wrote, “<em>Code is law</em>.” The underlying software and hardware of the internet regulate the architecture and infrastructure of cyberspace. Lessig wrote about how “open code,” or open-source software, could be a structural guarantee of substantive protections, like freedom of speech, in cyberspace. In the same way that the framers of the Constitution built checks on power into the structure of government to ensure substantive freedoms, he suggests that limitations of power be built into the code governing cyberspace. In other words, the internet should be built more like government in the American constitutional tradition.

Over a decade later, the inverse is a frequent refrain amongst open government supporters: government should work more like the internet. If code is law, perhaps we can also learn valuable lessons from treating <em>law as code</em>. The same concepts behind open-source software can be applied to the offline legal materials and codes that govern “real space.” Lessig argued that transparent code best embodies the constitutional values that characterize American democracy. It follows, then, that transparent <em>law -- </em>law that is available and accessible to citizens -- best embodies democratic and constitutional values.

<a href="http://public.resource.org/"><img src="http://codeforamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/lawgov.jpg" alt="" title="lawgov" width="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3879" /></a>As Carl Malamud of <a href="http://public.resource.org/">Public.Resource.Org</a> puts it, “The primary legal materials of the United States are the raw materials of our democracy.” This includes legal rulings, building codes, municipal and local laws: the “underpinnings of American civic life,” as described in an <a href="http://www.pressdemocrat.com/article/20100924/articles/100929642?tc=ar">interview</a> on PressDemocrat. To promote an informed and transparent democratic society, these codes that define infrastructure of daily life in cities and counties across the country should be widely and freely available to everyone.

Many local governments, like <a href="http://www.datakc.org/">King County</a> and <a href="http://www.sonoma-county.org/">Sonoma County</a>, already post civic data and copies of their municipal legal material online. But there are no standard formats for posting this information, making it difficult to search, or to compare data across cities or counties. Or, it might be costly to access: <a href="http://pacer.cafc.uscourts.gov/">PACER</a>, the federal courts online records system, <a href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/tag/pacer/">charges 8 cents per page</a> to view their online material, composed entirely of documents in the public domain. And, of course, many more branches of government simply don’t make their legal material accessible online at all.

<a href="http://resource.org/law.gov/">Law.Gov</a>, a sister project of Public.Resource.Org, is one nonprofit working to make law more transparent by advocating for bulk access to all legal materials online in standardized and open formats. As John Podesta, President of Center for American Progress said during a June 2010 <a href="http://www.americanprogress.org/events/2010/06/lawgov.html">Law.Gov workshop</a>:
<blockquote>“What it’s about is making all primary materials in the United States more readily available, from water districts, counties, cities, and states all the way up to the three branches of the federal government… What Law.Gov aims to achieve is changing how governmental bodies that make the law present their work product – pushing government to meet the basic requirement that the public has easy access to their work product.”</blockquote>
Standardizing and freely publishing legal codes of cities and counties online is a step in the right direction to encouraging participation and equal access to the raw materials of democracy. <a href="http://www.pressdemocrat.com/article/20100924/articles/100929642?p=1&amp;tc=pg">According to</a> Sonoma County Supervisor Efren Carrillo, one of the first governments working with Law.Gov to establish best practices for aggregating legal codes online,  “Making information readily available to the public is one of the pillars of having a transparent government, and a government that is effective.”
