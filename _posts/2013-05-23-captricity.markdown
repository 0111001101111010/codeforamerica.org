Captricity is an award-winning Berkeley, CA-based technology startup that offers a completely self-serve data entry service for digitizing paper forms. The app can transfer data from paper and into a digital spreadsheet quickly and cheaply, taking care of the data entry so you don’t have to! It's not an optical character recognition (OCR) service. It is human-quality data entry that works on hand-writing — but at a fraction of what manual data entry costs.
