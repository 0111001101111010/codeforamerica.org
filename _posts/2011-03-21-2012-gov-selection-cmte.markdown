<p>19 governments applied for our 2012 program, and it’s amazing to read about their project ideas, challenges, and passion for changing the way things work. As a growing start-up, we can only work directly with a handful next year, which is why they are selected through a competitive process. To help us evaluate these great proposals, we have put together a committee of government, industry, and thought leaders.</p>
<h3>2012 Program Selection Committee</h3>
<ul>
<li>Susan Christopherson – NAGW and County of Boulder</li>
<li>Carol Coletta – CEOs for Cities</li>
<li>Kevin Curry – City Camp</li>
<li>Andrew Greenhill – City of Tucson</li>
<li>Nigel Jacob – City of Boston</li>
<li>Clay Johnson – Big Windows Lab</li>
<li>Daniel X O’Neil – EveryBlock</li>
<li>Tim O’Reilly – Board of Directors</li>
</ul>
<p>We’re honored to have such a diverse and knowledgeable group of individuals helping us choose our partners for 2012.</p>
