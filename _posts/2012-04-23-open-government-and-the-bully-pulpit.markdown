<p>Last week in Honolulu, the Mayor <a href="http://dabushnl.eventbrite.com/">got on a bus</a>.</p>
<p>And while this may seem like a small thing, it’s just the latest example of how mayors and municipal leaders are using the weight of their offices to advance the agenda of open government.</p>
<p><img alt="Honolulu Mayor Peter Carlisle" height="269" src="http://codeforamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/carlisle.jpg" style="float: right; padding: 5px; margin-left: 1opx;" title="Honolulu Mayor Peter Carlisle" width="350"/></p>
<p>Mayors are not often known for their prowess at writing code. But that didn’t stop Mayor <a href="http://www1.honolulu.gov/mayor/">Peter Carlisle</a> of Honolulu – a 2012 Code for America partner city – from joining coders, designers, social media enthusiasts and other self professed “geeks” last week to discuss open transit data and civic applications at an event dubbed “Geeks on DaBus.”</p>
<p>Nor did it stop Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter from <a href="http://technicallyphilly.com/2012/02/27/mayor-michael-nutter-visits-code-across-america-civic-hackathon-lobbying-ph-wins-first-place">stopping by a Code for America hackathon</a> in his city several weeks ago to offer encouragement and thanks to members of the <a href="http://brigade.codeforamerica.org/">CfA Brigade</a>.</p>
<p>Mayors and other municipal leaders can send a powerful message with their actions – a message that can resonate with government employees and citizens about the strategic importance of open government. Almost nothing sends this message as clearly as how local leaders communicate their priorities.</p>
<p>Where are the leading cities in civic innovation putting their priorities?</p>
<p>The City of Chicago has <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2011/08/chicago-data-apps-open-government.html">appointed a Chief Data Officer</a>. The City of Boston has created an Office of <a href="http://www.newurbanmechanics.org/">New Urban Mechanics</a>. The cities of Philadelphia and San Francisco have appointed <a href="http://www.theatlanticcities.com/technology/2012/03/dawn-municipal-chief-innovation-officer/1516/">Chief Innovation Officers</a>.</p>
<p>These are just a few of the examples of how mayors and local government leaders are using the visibility and power of their offices to set the agenda for open government.</p>
<p>The message all of these leaders are sending is clear – open government, civic coding and citizen engagement are critical elements of successful governance in 2012 and beyond.</p>
