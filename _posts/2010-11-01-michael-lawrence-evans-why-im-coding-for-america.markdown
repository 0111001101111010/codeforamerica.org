<p>I’ve been amazed by how useful municipal data can be. I’ve also been surprised by the disorganization of city data. When data is disorganized or inaccessible, cities become less transparent. Residents lose the benefits that the data and data-driven applications can provide.</p>
<p>My favorite example of the power of data transparency is Stamen Design’s <a href="http://oakland.crimespotting.org">Oakland Crimespotting</a>. It’s an incredibly useful application that helps Oakland residents research crime in their city. The problem was simple: Oakland residents did not have a complete picture of all of the crime in their neighborhoods. Despite Oakland’s history with high crime, the San Francisco Bay Area’s news outlets underreported crime in troubled  neighborhoods. Moreover, the crime data was not easily <a href="http://mike.teczno.com/notes/oakland-crime-maps/I.html">accessible</a> to residents. Stamen’s developers even had challenges obtaining a <a href="http://mike.teczno.com/notes/oakland-crime-maps/X.html">reliable</a> data feed.</p>
<p>It’s important to break down the barriers between public data and citizens. Local agencies are some of our most prolific data gatherers. There is also a growing contingent of city officials who are passionate about opening public data. Code for America can be a missing link in providing platforms that make data accessible and easy to use.</p>
