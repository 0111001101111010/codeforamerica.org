<p><a href="http://codeforamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/AED-e1322872808153.jpg"><img alt="" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-9972" height="189" src="http://codeforamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/AED-e1322872808153.jpg" title="AED" width="150"/></a>When you need an automated external defibrillator (AED) you don’t have time to search around or wait for one. It’s a matter of life or death and each second counts.</p>
<p>Whereas in the past, you’d have to wait for first responders with knowledge of the nearest AED to come for help, new technology — like the <a href="http://firedepartment.mobi/">San Ramon Fire Department’s Save a Life app</a> — enables trained citizens anywhere to be called into action, with a notification of nearby emergency and information on the closest AED. The San Ramon app has <a href="http://sanramon.patch.com/articles/fire-district-adds-life-saving-cpr-dispatch-to-iphone-app-makes-app-available-to-other-fire-departments">already saved lives</a>. Clearly, this app has tremendous potential to help citizens — and not just in San Ramon. Every city could benefit from this kind of technology; however, for it to work, there needs to be an up-to-date, reliable, and open database of AED locations. Fortunately, a group of urbanists and technologists — including Javier Muniz of Granicus and Adriel Hampton of NationBuilder — have come together to build and the tech needed to crowdsource that data.</p>
<p>But they need your help. The app has been <a href="https://github.com/gov20cto/huzzah" target="_blank">prototyped</a>, and they are continuing development. This weekend (December 10 &amp; 11), at the <a href="http://www.wiredtoshare.com/citycampsf_hackathon">CityCampSF hackathon</a>, <a href="http://www.wiredtoshare.com/open_aed_finder">you can join them</a> in making this important, much needed application a reality.</p>
