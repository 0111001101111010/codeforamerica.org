Calling all repo managers, coders, designers, civic-minded volunteers: we want you!
<p dir="ltr">Today we’re kicking off <a href="http://brigade.codeforamerica.org/civic-coding">The Great American Civic Hack</a>—a three-month campaign to clean up the top civic repos and make them fork and merge ready.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The campaign will feature four to six repos for national collaboration. The managers of these repos will identify issues, milestones, and deadlines. Civic hackers can jump on these projects to do what we do best: push code.</p>

<h3>How can I get involved now?</h3>
<p dir="ltr">From May 8 - 30, 2013, <a href="http://cfabrigade.ideascale.com/">nominate and vote for repos</a> you’d like to see featured at on national level. June 1, let the hacking begin!</p>
<p dir="ltr">Individual Brigades can also participate by <a href="http://cfabrigade.ideascale.com/">submitting repos</a> they’d like to work on locally with their group during the campaign. Though these won’t be featured nationally, we want to recognize the work all Brigades are doing in their communities.</p>

<h3>Why this campaign?</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Summer is a great time to pitch in to make our communities better. Coding is one way to roll up our sleeves and help.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We created this campaign because we believe that as good, open source citizens, we need to build our infrastructure and take care of the repos important to our community.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We’re excited to see what happens when we collaborate as a national network. Imagine what we can code together.</p>

<h3>How does National Day of Civic Hacking tie in?</h3>
<p dir="ltr">The Great American Civic Hack will be punctuated by the <a href="http://hackforchange.org/">National Day of Civic Hacking</a> on June 1 - 2, 2013. During that weekend, we’ll join with 80+ other events across the country to highlight the power of civic hacking.</p>
