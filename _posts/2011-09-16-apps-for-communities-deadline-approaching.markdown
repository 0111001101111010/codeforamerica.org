<a href="http://appsforcommunities.challenge.gov/">Apps for Communities</a> <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/2011/05/24/code-for-oakland-june-4th/">challenges</a> developers and designers with creating apps that improve daily life in cities by making local public information more personalized, usable, and actionable. Led by the <a href="http://fcc.gov">FCC</a> and the <a href="http://knightfoundation.org">Knight Foundation</a>, the apps contest is has had over 45 submissions so far, and the deadline is approaching: October 3! 

The competition is structured in a way that'll hopefully enable sustainability and growth for the apps: they are offering $100k in prizes â€” $30k as the grand prize, $20k for 2nd, $10k for 3rd, and many bonuses for different categories such as best design and visualization, best use of SMS, digital proficiency, and English literacy, etc. It'll be great to see civic hackers take this opportunity to turn their ideas into real businesses. 

The judging panel includes, Marc Andreessen of Andreessen Horowitz, Charles Best of DonorsChoose.org, Cory Booker, Mayor of Newark, Brad Feld of Foundry Group, Tom Lee of Sunlight Labs, and our own Jennifer Pahlka.

The deadline is coming up! Be sure to get your application in soon: <a href="http://appsforcommunities.challenge.gov/">http://appsforcommunities.challenge.gov/</a>
