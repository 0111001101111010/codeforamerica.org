<p dir="ltr">Hello, my name is CJ Bryan and I am proud to be a part of this year's set of Code for America Fellows. I've been fascinated with both the computers and governments for a long time. They're both amazing machines that enable us to do things that we might never have imagined. I've always strived to work in ways that combined these interests. Working with smaller activist groups and with other developers on open source software has always been an outlet for me to help make these two worlds closer.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Importantly, there is a great fundamental difference with Code for America. As a group that works directly with local governments, it fosters a great environment where cities can articulate their concerns directly to those implementing the solution and the result is a better fit for the city and for the end user. Action and collaboration like this is a great step forward, and I'm proud to be a part of the groups helping make this happen.</p>
I decided to Code for America because I believe that the state of the software that powers our city governments isn't as good as it could be. I think that the wild world of tech software can help cities become better cities. I think that they can become better cities through sharing solutions to their problems and collaborating between themselves and outside organizations.
