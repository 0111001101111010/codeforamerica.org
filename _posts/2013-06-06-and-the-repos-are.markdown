<p>We’re excited to kick off the second stage of the Great American Civic Hack: a three month campaign to take our favorite open source, civic repos to the next level; to close issues, reach milestones, add new features, and generally make code fork and merge ready.</p>
<p>In May, we put out a call for repos. We asked for repos we could organize to work on as a national network and invited people to vote on which repos they’d like to see featured. We’re excited to announce the repos we’ll be working on as a national community this summer:</p>
<ol>
<li>CKAN</li>
<li>LocalWiki</li>
<li>Procure.io</li>
<li>We The People</li>
<li>Councilmatic</li>
<li>OpenTreeMap</li>
<li>Brigade Platform</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>How can you get involved on a national project?</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://docs.google.com/a/codeforamerica.org/document/d/1QcUrUcAHu8eYXdLT7VeX0uLBlkKdCRKwWKYnoyN63qY/edit#">Learn about the featured repos</a>.</li>
<li>Fork ‘em.</li>
<li>Close issues.</li>
<li>Issue pulls.</li>
<li>Not a coder? <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/codeforamerica.org/document/d/1QcUrUcAHu8eYXdLT7VeX0uLBlkKdCRKwWKYnoyN63qY/edit#">Help test features or add or edit documentation processes</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>How can you get involved locally?</strong></p>
<p>In addition to these select repos, Brigades across the country will be working on local repos for their communities as a part of the campaign. If you’d like us to track your local repo during the campaign, showcase your progress, and reward you if you accomplish your goals, <a href="http://brigade.codeforamerica.org/civic-coding">submit your local repo</a> before June 15, 2013.</p>
