<p>As a policy student, I wasn’t quite sure what to expect from a summer internship at Code for America, though, I understand the technical opportunities present for governments. In my application, I asked “If our personal lives can be so improved by Web 2.0, why shouldn’t our government be too?”  Living in the Bay Area, I have always been particularly curious about the region’s risk for earthquakes. I wanted to know what kind of damages San Francisco could expect to see, what kinds of post-disaster technologies have been created elsewhere that could be employed locally.</p>
<p>I spent my CfA summer working on DisasterMath, <a href="http://www.disastermath.org/">www.DisasterMath.org</a>, a project that lets cities and countries understand how well they coped with a disaster relative to other countries like them. I started with a dataset of disasters, which included information on duration, location, and type of disaster. I went on to match disasters with severity levels specific to their type (e.g., fires &amp; hectares burned, earthquake &amp; richter scale). Additionally, because a country’s ability to respond to a disaster depends greatly on their development level, I used a number of World Bank Data Indicators to rank countries’ development on a scale of 1 to 5. I then ran a regression predicting deaths and damages using development, severity, and type of disaster.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, eight weeks wasn’t enough time to complete the project. I’ll continue working on DisasterMath as I finish my last year of graduate school, improving the model and making the data available online, in the hopes that one day it will be a resourceful tool for cities in disaster planning. But in those eight weeks, I learned so many skills that will prove useful to me in my career as a policy analyst / technocrat. I went from being a complete novice to being completely comfortable using Git, data scrapping on the web, and even attending a Railsbridge workshop. I’ll be going to PyStar next weekend and spend a few hours a week learning Protovis. As a result of my summer, I’ve gained great skills, but more importantly, I’ve gained the realization that my future in government will certainly revolve around leveraging technology and data.</p>
