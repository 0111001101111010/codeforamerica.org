<a href="http://codeforamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/socialcontract.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-13684" title="socialcontract" src="http://codeforamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/socialcontract-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a>I've never been able to fit into a perfect mold as just a "lawyer" or an "engineer."  As much as I enjoy expression of useful ideas in software, I also really enjoy exploring and expressing the nuances of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_contract">social contract</a> at work in this country that I love.

In the private sector, technology and open data has been a disruptive force against monopoly for years, affording Americans greater consumer choices from broadband access to the way we buy real estate. And as web technology and user interface/experience science evolves, the choices grow even larger. In my mind though, the real jewel of technology disruption remains with government - the heart of the social contract - being "A Part of It All."

As a society, we are still missing something though when professionals (be they lawyers or programmers) assume that the only way to explore the social contract is through their <em>particular medium of expression</em>. You can find dozens of law review articles by lawyers on technology's place in law and legal systems, but much fewer realizations of these ideas in <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> repos. All the same, there are quite a few <a href="http://www.docracy.com/">budding law tech platforms</a> aimed at exploring/disrupting the practice of law, but in these, I don't see full integration of all of the contingencies and breadth of circumstances that a thoughtful law review article, or a court opinion covers.

Perhaps it is due to the reward structure in the two distinct law vs tech sectors favoring either difficult-to-understand-by-the-public academic texts or oversimplified software platforms.  I don't think understanding the law should be a privilege only for legal academics, nor do I agree with tech platforms promising disruption, but merely rediscovering (through a series of costly errors) the reason why law may be a bit esoteric to begin with.

As a Code for America fellow last year, I was in the unique position to both <a href="http://www.snapfresh.org">code</a> and <a href="http://wiki.civiccommons.org/Legal_and_Procurement_Issues_Guide">write</a> about social contract issues. Then, earlier this year thanks to a <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/author/joe/">2012 fellow</a>, I was encouraged to pitch a session topic for the <a href="http://www.innovateactivate.org/">Innovate/Activate conference</a> and started a project I've called "<a href="https://github.com/jerseycoder/USPTO3PS">PatentBat</a>."

I found at I/A that I wasn't alone - there is a growing number of "Lawyers who Code" trying to thoughtfully and ethically integrate the <a href="http://www.lawgives.org/live/">nuanced knowledge of the law with technology</a>. The aim is to leverage tech into the zeal of zealous advocacy, to make it <em>better</em>, rather than focusing exclusively on being cheap. After all, can you put a price on the social contract?

This philosophy is what drives civil servants also, as I saw a month ago attending a meeting of my local chapter of the <a href="http://brigade.codeforamerica.org/">Code for America Brigade</a>. Two town officials from bordering cities/counties attended and began a dialogue on collaborating over front end development for Open 311. They realized the <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/clay_shirky_how_cognitive_surplus_will_change_the_world.html">cognitive surplus</a> of the Brigade as a way to make the service <em>better</em>, not just make it cheaper.

From my experiences at Code for America and after, it seems that government has a place for people expressing <em>better</em>, not just cheaper. As a patent examiner with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, I aim to write thoughtful <a href="http://www.uspto.gov/trademarks/process/update/oa.jsp">actions</a>, while acquiring expertise to thoughtfully integrate into tech platforms I work on in my free time like PatentBat. Maybe, in a few years then, I'll have a new label: an "Administrative Law Judge that Codes."
