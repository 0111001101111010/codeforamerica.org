This week, the Boston team had the opportunity to participate in the Ignite Boston to talk about our work with CfA and how we're hoping to use technology to improve education. We tried to give a sense of what we're doing but also stick to the Ignite motto: "Enlighten us, but make it quick." Video from the talk is below.
