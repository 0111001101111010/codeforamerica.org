<p>Central to Code For America’s mission are the great and collaborative relationships we establish with innovative cities throughout the country.  It’s through these relationships that positive change happens – engaging the community to help in the work of government, leveraging technology more effectively to solve civic issues, and creating efficiencies within and between governments.</p>
<p>To help us develop and grow our city relationships, we are really excited to announce that Mark Headd, technologist and innovator extraordinaire, will be joining us to head up our Government Relations.</p>
<p>Mark is well known as a passionate blogger, engaging speaker, and advisor on issues of government and technology – which no doubt has been informed by his tenure at the State of Delaware and the State of New York, and most recently, as Developer Evangelist for Voxeo Labs.</p>
<p>But Mark’s involvement goes well beyond <a href="http://civic.io/">blogging</a>, speaking, and advising.  One simply has to look at his active participation in organizing civic hacking events, supporting civic efforts, and building civic software and it is easy to see his level of passion and commitment.</p>
<p>In both his work life and his civic life Mark has made a difference – and we are excited to have his talent, passion, and commitment as part of the Code For America effort.  We hope you will join us in welcoming Mark to his new position.</p>
