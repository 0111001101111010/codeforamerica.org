<p>Earlier today, the First Lady Michelle Obama and Dr. Jill Biden, along with President Obama and Vice President Biden, launched <a href="http://joiningforces.gov">Joining Forces</a>, the administration’s national initiative to support and honor America’s service members and their families. The initiative aims to educate, challenge, and spark action from all sectors of our society to ensure military families have the support they have earned. As President Obama said in the announcement today, “This can’t be the work of government alone.”</p>

<p>Code for America will be focusing on addressing the unique challenges of veteran employment and education, while engaging in a comprehensive effort to raise awareness about the service, sacrifice, and needs of military families. A team of Code for America fellows will be working with federal agencies, private companies, and non-profits to leverage the power of the internet to provide military service members, their spouses, and veterans with new tools for finding jobs and workforce development programs.</p>
<p>As part of this partnership, Code for America has joined forces with Jake Brewer of Fission Strategy. Since 2001, Jake Brewer has worked to turn good ideas into effective, responsible results through organizations including the Sunlight Foundation and Idealist.org.</p>
<p>Our partnership formally kicked off just today, and we’ve got a lot work ahead of us. This week, the team is in Washington DC, conducting interviews with veterans and their families, as well as government officials in the VA, Department of Labor, and military. Over the next few months, we will continue interviewing, researching, and working to find the best way we serve our veterans.</p>
<p>We believe matching veterans with career opportunities presents a unique and promising opportunity for innovation and collaboration. We will work to bring together the public and private sectors across the country, where veterans and their families are returning home every day.</p>
