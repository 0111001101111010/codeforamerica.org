<h1>What is<strong> Open Government</strong>?</h1>
Open government is a movement to bring government into the digital age by making public data open by default and creating new opportunities for civic engagement using the web as a platform.

An open government is:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Transparent</strong>: Open governments ensure accountability and informed civic participation by making the actions of government known to all.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Participatory</strong>: Open governments leverage technology to make public information accessible and create innovative tools to engage citizens in government decision-making. Open governments promote creative problem-solving in local government by encouraging city departments to cooperate and share information. Cooperation among government agencies, the public, non-profits, and the private sector allows the success of innovative ideas and partnerships.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Accessible:</strong> Open governments not only make sure public information is shared, but that anyone can use and access it.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Efficient</strong>: Open governments enable programmers, non-profits, and community activists to develop valuable civic tools powered by public data which help government better serve the public.</p>
An<strong> Open Government</strong> will achieve these principles by:
<ul>
	<li>Providing broader access to information</li>
	<li>Liberating datasets for the public use</li>
	<li>Promoting the reuse of public data by the public and private sector</li>
	<li>Pursuing tech innovation in government services by encouraging a culture of experimentation</li>
</ul>
