<p>With only a <strong>few days left to apply</strong> for the <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/fellows">Code for America fellowship</a>, we are starting to review the applications we have received. While we’ve been impressed by the candidates’ credentials and experiences, what stands out the most are their responses to the basic prompt: “Why do you want to participate in Code for America?” We decided to pipe them into the <a href="http://wordle.net">Wordle.net</a> word cloud generator, so you can take a look for yourself:</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="cfa-why" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1203" src="http://codeforamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/cfa-why.png" title="Wordcloud Courtesy Wordle.net" width="600"/></p>
<p>This says to us that people “believe” in “government,” “technology,” and “people,” and that they “want” to “make” something. That’s exactly what we’re looking for. If feel the same way, we encourage you to <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/apply">apply to join them</a>: <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/apply">http://codeforamerica.org/apply</a>. </p>
<p>We promise, you’ll be in good company.</p>
