We're excited to be teaming up with Applications for Good, the San Francisco Department of Technology, and Goodwill Industries to host a SF code-a-thon focused on developing fun and engaging mobile apps for local families, apps that help them learn, save money, find jobs, and build financial security. Not only will the participants get the chance to make a difference, they'll also have the opportunity to win up to $50k in prizes! Times running out, so <a href="http://applicationsforgood.org/san-francisco/">register now</a>: <a href="http://applicationsforgood.org/san-francisco/">http://applicationsforgood.org/san-francisco/</a>  

This San Francisco code-a-thon is one of three taking place nationwide. Over the weekend, San Francisco participants can win up to $1,000 in local prizes, and since we’re hosting this event to help you qualify for the national contest sponsored by Applications for Good and AT&T, they're also eligble for the national competition closing May 16 which features over $50k in prizes.

<strong>What</strong>: Apps for Good San Francisco Code-a-thon
<strong>Where</strong>: 1 South Van Ness, 2nd Floor, Atrium
<strong>When</strong>: Friday, May 6th 3pm and onwards
<strong>Register</strong>: <a href="http://applicationsforgoodsf.eventbrite.com">http://applicationsforgoodsf.eventbrite.com</a>
<strong>Details</strong>: <a href="http://applicationsforgood.org/san-francisco/">http://applicationsforgood.org/san-francisco/</a>

The two-day event will be part bar-camp and part hack-day. Friday afternoon we’ll hear from community partners about the needs facing the community and some of the great solutions that are being used today. We're hoping developers will attend though as well to start their minds working the night before, and to collaborate with the community partners. On Saturday morning, we'll start off with project pitches: you'll have a few minutes to present your idea and build a team around your app. Saturday afternoon teams will compete for prizes and recognition by the judging panel, made up of technology and civic leaders.

The event is this weekend, so register now to secure your spot! <a href="http://applicationsforgood.org/san-francisco/ ">http://applicationsforgood.org/san-francisco/ </a>
