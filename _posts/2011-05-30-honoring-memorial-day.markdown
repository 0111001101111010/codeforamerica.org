<p>Today, across the country, we observe Memorial Day. There are barbeques and tee times, family gatherings and neighborhood parties, but at the core, of course, is the solemn recognition and appreciate of the service performed by men and women in uniform throughout our history. Here at Code for America, we’re <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/2011/04/12/joining-forces-with-the-white-house-to-help-veterans-find-jobs/">grateful</a> for their work and the sacrifices they make; theirs is truly the highest form of public service. We wanted to take this opportunity to highlight some submissions from <a href="http://WeLovePublicService.org">WeLovePublicService.org</a> that seemed appropriate on this day:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“Thanks to everyone, military and civilian, who protect our safety.”</em><br/>
— Jeffrey, Arlington, VA</p>
<p><em>“To my Dad, a 30+ year DoD/Army auditor who taught me to honor, respect and value public service.”</em><br/>
— Matt, Washington DC</p>
<p><em>“He’s serving us in the US Army. He &amp; his family’s sacrifice &amp; service are admirable &amp; honorable.”</em><br/>
— John Carson, Honolulu, HI</p>
<p><em>“Thank you to the men and women who risk their lives for our nation overseas!”</em><br/>
 — Noah, Atlanta, GA</p>
<p><em>“Thank you to all the branches of the military for protecting us keeping us save and our freedom”</em><br/>
— Debbie Little, Wilmington , OH</p></blockquote>
<p>We just wanted to share our support and appreciation, and we hope that you’ll take a moment today to do the same.</p>
