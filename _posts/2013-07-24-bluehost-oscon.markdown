<p><a href="”http://bluehost.com”">Bluehost</a> is one of Code for America’s largest corporate donors, supporting us for the second year in a row at the $250,000 level. We are so grateful for the support of founder Hari Ravichandran and the entire Bluehost team, who share our belief in the power of the open source community.</p>

<p>While we know Bluehost’s commitment to CfA, they continue to surprise us with their generosity. This week they invited us to share the stage on Thursday morning at <a href="http://www.oscon.com/oscon2013">OSCON</a> with Bluehost’s Director of Open Source Outreach, Jared Smith, where he will ask attendees to support CfA in hopes of matching Bluehost’s donation. It’s not every day that our CTO <a href="https://twitter.com/michalmigurski">Michal Migurski</a> gets a chance to address more than 3,000 open source developers, and we can’t thank Bluehost enough for making this happen — and for challenging the audience to rally behind CfA’s mission.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We made a commitment to help move Code for America’s efforts forward by encouraging the open source community, our employees and customers, to become involved in coding for a better government.”</p>
<p>— Hari Ravichandran, founder and CEO of Endurance International Group (Bluehost’s parent company)</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>HOW OPEN SOURCE IS POWERING BETTER GOVERNMENTS</strong></p>
<p>Our local governments are already benefiting from what the open source community has to offer. For every civic tech problem we solve, there are a dozen other cities in need of the same solution. This is why all of Code for America’s applications are open source with both the code and documentation <a href="”http://brigade.codeforamerica.org/pages/opensource”">released for public use and redeployment</a>.</p>
<p>The open source ethos allows us to share our resources, insights and code in order to improve our communities en masse. It’s the difference between building into a vacuum or harnessing a rolling thunder of change. As an open source developer, you’ve got a chance to help us code the next chapter of American history.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Answer Bluehost’s call to action: join Code for America by applying for our one-year <a href="”http://codeforamerica.org/apply”">Fellowship program</a>, attending a <a href="”http://brigade.codeforamerica.org/pages/events”">Brigade event</a> in your city, and <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/bluehost" target="_blank">donating to CfA</a> to support our Fellows, Brigade volunteers, and civic entrepreneurs. Together we can build government by the people, for the people that works in the 21st century.</p>
