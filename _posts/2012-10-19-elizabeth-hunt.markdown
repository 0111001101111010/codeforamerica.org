<p>Elizabeth Hunt is a user experience strategist and designer. After graduating from the University of New Mexico with a Ph.D. in English Literature, she began working in the technology industry. Over the past ten years, she’s worked as a web designer, instructional designer, user experience designer, and creative director. During that time, she’s designed applications and online experiences, as well as a travel program, for clients such as American Express Travel, Target, and Microsoft.</p>
<p>As a fellow at Code for America, Liz designed and built <a href="http://www.neighborhow.org" title="Visit Neighborhow" target="_blank">Neighborhow</a> to make it easy for Philadelphians to find and share ways to improve their neighborhoods. Neighborhow is an ongoing experiment she'll keep working on with the City of Philadephia after the fellowship. She also designed and built <a href="http://www.cityhow.org" title="Visit CityHow" target="_blank">CityHow</a>, which repurposes the Neighborhow codebase to collect and share informal knowledge among people who work for the City of Philadelphia.</p>

<p>Liz is actively seeking new opportunities as part of an organization that's focused on improving the everyday lives of people and on making our world a better place to live.</p>
