<p>This year, we’re starting early.</p>
<p>Last year, we were overwhelmed by the response for our inaugural application — over 350 submissions! — but just days after the application process closed in the fall, people started asking when 2012′s would open up. That’s why last week, <a href="http://blogs.forbes.com/davidewalt/2011/03/11/tim-oreilly-speaks-at-sxsw/">Tim O’Reilly</a> announced the launch of the 2012 CfA fellowship application at SXSW. We’re now accepting applications for the <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/fellows">2012 Code for America Fellowship</a>. <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/fellows/apply"><strong>Apply now</strong></a>.</p>
<p>We’re also finishing early this year too — kind of. We realize that for graduating seniors, waiting until September to hear about a post-grad job is tough; you want to have an answer of what you’re doing in the real-world as soon as possible, preferably before graduation. Trust me, I know. This year, we’re rolling out an <strong>early decision recruitment cycle</strong>, so you can have an answer back from us by May 1. For that to work, however, you’ll need to get in your application as soon as possible: the deadline for the early decision cycle is April 15.  (This process will complement our regular decision program, for which applications are due July 31 and decisions are made by September 1.) We hope college students and anyone else interested will take this opportunity to <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/fellows/apply">apply early</a> for next year’s program.</p>
<p>While thinking about how to explain the value of the CfA fellowship to a recent grad, I realized that I didn’t really have to. Fortunately, a few of our fellows already have. In their applications last year, we asked every potential fellow, “Why do you want to Code for America?”, and since they were so good, when they started this year, we had them edit them into short bios for the site. So here’s the response from <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/author/scott">Scott Silverman</a>, 23, a recent graduate from Tufts University and one of our fellows taking on the <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/boston">Boston project</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>As a recent graduate with leadership, technology and media experience, I am ready to face the real world, take ownership over projects and innovate with the goal of redefining how government operates. In this respect, Code for America is an extremely attractive opportunity. The prospect of working with (and learning from) 19 other bright and motivated CfA fellows excites me. I have been searching for individuals like myself to collaborate and innovate on exciting new ideas. While I am eager to put my own skills and ideas to work, I recognize that I still have much to learn. For this reason, I see Code for America’s development and partnership aspects as instrumental in my personal development process. The ability to learn new techniques and skills from tech industry leaders and put them to work in real-world situations is rare.</em></p>
<p>I am eager to make waves in this exciting new frontier and bring the web revolution to American cities, where it can impact the lives of millions. This reason, above all else, fuels my desire to Code for America. It is the perfect hybrid between technology and public service. Code for America is the beginning of a new revolution, one that integrates the web with the core of our communities‚ and it is a privilege to be a 2011 Fellow. Now let’s get to work.</p></blockquote>
