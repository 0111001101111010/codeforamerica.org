Built during the <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/2011-fellows/">2011 Fellowship year</a> for the City of Boston by Joel Mahoney, Karla Macedo and Talin Salway, <a href="https://schoolbus.bostonpublicschools.org/">Where’s My School Bus</a> offers real-time school bus tracking for parents.

A student’s bus is displayed on a detailed map, showing both its recent and current location. Waiting at the stop for a late bus? Blizzard got traffic moving at a crawl? Use your smartphone or computer to instantly check the bus location. Tracking your student’s bus has never been easier, faster or more accurate.
