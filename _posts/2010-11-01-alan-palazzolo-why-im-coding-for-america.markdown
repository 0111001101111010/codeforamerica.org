I have always loved coding and building and have spent most of my professional experience in the non-profit and NGO sectors.  I have also always been interested in the concepts of open source and open data in government as a way to make government more efficient, participatory, and democratic. Code for America offers the unique opportunity to explore these ideas by not just creating a new service in a city, but by being change agents in government.

My technical roots are in web development, Drupal, web mapping, and data visualization, which I will utilize to help government and Code for America accomplish their missions.
