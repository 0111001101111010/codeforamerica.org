School selection is a complicated process that can leave parents feeling frustrated and confused.

Factors like school location, admissions quotas and sibling attendance can impact a student's eligibility. Meanwhile, features like test scores, historical admissions data, and transportation options can fit more or less perfectly with a parent's preferences and expectations.

DiscoverBPS combines eligibility criteria, school data, and advanced mapping tools to help parents search for and compare their top choices.

Created by the <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/2011-fellows/">2011 Boston Code for America fellowship team</a> of Joel Mahoney, Karla Macedo and Talin Salway and in partnership with the <a href="http://www.newurbanmechanics.org/">Mayor's Office of New Urban Mechanics</a>, this app helps parents answer the important question: Which school is right for my child?

As of August 2013, the app had 15,063 unique users with an average site visit time of four minutes and 20 seconds. In just two years, half the parents in Boston with school-eligible children are using this service.
