<p><a href="https://us.pycon.org/2012/">PyCon</a> is the largest annual gathering for the <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/pycon_logo.gif"><img alt="" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-11007" height="109" src="http://codeforamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/pycon_logo-300x109.gif" title="pycon_logo" width="300"/></a><br/>
community using the Python programming language. The conference has been growing in size tremendously over the past couple years (this year will feature <a href="http://pycon.blogspot.com/2012/01/pycon-2012-news-tutorials-talks-and.html">more than 90 talks and 30 tutorials</a>).</p>
<p>Today, Code for America is happy to announce we’ll be one of the F/OSS sponsors — meaning we’ll be partnering with PyCon in helping spread information on our values, the use of open-source technologies, and Python. We’re incredibly excited to go!</p>
