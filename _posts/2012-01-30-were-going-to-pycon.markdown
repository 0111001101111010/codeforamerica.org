community using the Python programming language. The conference has been growing in size tremendously over the past couple years (this year will feature <a href="http://pycon.blogspot.com/2012/01/pycon-2012-news-tutorials-talks-and.html">more than 90 talks and 30 tutorials</a>).

Today, Code for America is happy to announce we'll be one of the F/OSS sponsors â€” meaning we'll be partnering with PyCon in helping spread information on our values, the use of open-source technologies, and Python. We're incredibly excited to go!
