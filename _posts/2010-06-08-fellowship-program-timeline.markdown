<h1>How it Works</h1>
The Code for America fellowship is an 11-month program where developers, designers, UX/UI researchers and project managers work alongside city staff to produce open-source <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/fellows/program-and-timeline/%E2%80%9Dhttp://codeforamerica.org/apps%E2%80%9D">apps</a> and improve the citizen experience. In addition to your <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/fellows/training/">training and mentorship</a>, you’ll receive a stipend of $35,000 USD, a professional development budget, travel expenses and health care benefits.
<h1>Where You’ll Be</h1>
You’ll work at the <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/IqhhH">Code for America HQ in downtown San Francisco</a> for the bulk of your <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/fellows/training/">training</a> and travel to your host city in February to interview community stakeholders, collaborate with city staff and test your applications.<em>(*Note: Partner cities are not announced until after the July 31 <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/fellows/apply">application deadline</a>. You’ll be asked for your top 3 choices upon program acceptance.)</em>
