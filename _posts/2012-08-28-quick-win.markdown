<p><strong>Day 1 of being in Santa Cruz, Calif.</strong><br/>
The maps around city hall are confusing, out of date, and the display cases are fogged up:</p>

<p>City’s website is no better:</p>

<p><strong>CfA January training</strong>: “Look for quick wins.”</p>
<p>I make a <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msid=209512327102246183896.0004b7ed3faaa9791a0bc&amp;msa=0&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;t=m&amp;ll=36.974924,-122.028365&amp;spn=0.012,0.018239&amp;z=17&amp;source=embed" target="_blank">Google Map</a> with all the city offices and their hours. I also draw a printable <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/SMALLMAP.pdf" target="_blank">vector map</a> of where the buildings are located.</p>
<p><strong>CfA January training:</strong> “Find a city ally who can champion your project.”</p>
<p>Crystal Birns, City Arts Program Manager for Santa Cruz, is excited to help. She tells me what information to keep in / take out of the City Hall map.</p>
<p>I measure the display boxes and design a map of the City Hall building and its Annex.</p>
<p>Crystal drinks San Pellegrino like it’s water. I learn this while teaching her Adobe Illustrator. After four lunches she has the skills needed to update the maps on her own.</p>
<p>Crystal sends the map around to the city departments. I make changes based on their feedback and the map is sent around again.</p>
<p>And again. And again.</p>
<p>And again.</p>
<p>I tell Crystal I am fine with what ever they decide, but I need to move on.  I will not be hurt if my icons or type size are changed. I leave it in her hands.</p>
<p><strong>CfA January training:</strong> “Be patient. Government turns like a battleship.”</p>
<p><strong>Month 7 of fellowship<br/>
</strong>Crystal emails me a <a href="http://cityofsantacruz.com/index.aspx?page=1860" target="_blank">link</a>. The city website has been updated with the Google Map and printable PDF.</p>
<p><strong>Month 8 of fellowship<br/>
</strong>Crystal sends me photos of the four new campus maps:</p>

<p>Hang Ten Crystal!</p>
