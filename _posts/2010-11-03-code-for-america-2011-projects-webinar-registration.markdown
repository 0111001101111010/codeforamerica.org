Code for America - 2011 Projects Overview
Code for America's fellowship program connects civic-minded technologists with local governments to build web apps that make cities work better. In our inaugural year, we have partnered with four cities ‚Äì Boston, Philadelphia, Seattle, and Washington DC ‚Äì to address local problems our fellows can solve with innovative and reusable technology. After months of brainstorming and development, we are excited to share with you our vision for what those applications will be and how they can help cities become more efficient, participatory and open.
 
We invite you to join us (link to register) for our Code for America 2011 Projects Overview on Tuesday, November 16, 2010, at 1pm PT. In a brief webinar, we will go over the program and each project, including some use cases and key features, and then we will answer questions from the audience. If you've been wondering what kind of work we will be doing or how to get involved, this is your opportunity to find out.
