<p><a href="http://blightstatus.nola.gov">BlightStatus</a> is an online tool that aims to answer the question, “What’s going on with that abandoned house down the street?”</p>
<p>Vacant and abandoned properties have become a huge problem for many cities. The story is clear: these properties drain city resources and cast a shadow over a neighborhood’s progress and quality of life.</p>
<p>The problem is a hard one to solve. Just try to find information about the status of a property in the blight abatement process – it’s harder than you think. Without a centralized place to access that information, individuals and organizations working to return these properties back to productive use are being held back.</p>
<p>By making the status of properties public and easily browsable, BlightStatus will “help government and community groups make informed decisions regarding blight abatement, demolition and real estate use.”</p>
<p>Tune in to this episode where fellows in New Orleans, Macon, and Detroit join us to talk about how BlightStatus can help their cities deal with the crisis of blight.</p>
