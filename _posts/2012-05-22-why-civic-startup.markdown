<p>Last week, <a href="http://www.good.is/post/part-peace-corps-part-venture-capital-code-for-america-s-plan-for-public-innovation/">Good Magazine featured</a> the launch of our <a href="/accelerator">Civic Startup Accelerator</a>, which prompted a bunch of tweets — mostly supportive, some curious, but <a href="http://twitter.com/ChaseAdam17/status/201326802189291520 ">one</a> however caught my eye:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p>Peace Corps meets VC meets Silicon Valley. But why not just work for a startup? <a href="http://t.co/5hi9uKbu" title="http://bit.ly/Js0TH5">bit.ly/Js0TH5</a></p>

<p><script charset="utf-8" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script></p>
<p>Basically it’s the question why a civic startup and not just a traditional one… I  have actually gotten this question a couple of times, and it’s nontrivial. Particularly with the staggering level of activity in the consumer web, why take on the often times daunting notion of the <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/2012/01/09/kevin-curry-why-im-coding-for-america/">civic web</a>? </p>
<p>So I figured I’d ask the people actually doing it. I turned to a few civic entreprenuers who have graciously agreed to be mentors for our Accelerator to describe their motivation and rationale for working in this space:</p>
<p>Ryan Alfred (<a href="http://twitter.com/ryanalfred">@ryanalfred</a>), co-founder, <a href="http://brightscope.com">BrightScope</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Startups are very personal. Usually successful founders are tackling unsolved problems that matter to them personally. A civic startup is nothing more than a startup founded by entrepreneurs who noticed that our government has some huge issues, and who believe that a startup is a better and more accessible platform than politics to solve these issues.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Steve Ressler (<a href="http://twitter.com/govloop">@govloop</a>), founder, <a href="http://govloop.com">GovLoop</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>As Tim O’Reilly said “Do something that matters.” Civic startups have big markets, less competition, and huge problems with more meaning (improve lives of citizens VS another fart app).  </p>
<p>There is no better time to work in a civic startup — with decreasing budgets and increased government data, government is ripe for disruption and more receptive than ever to new innovative solutions to civic problems.</p></blockquote>
<p>For anyone else working on a civic startup or initiative, we’d love to hear why you’re up for it. Share your responses in the comments, and don’t forget that the deadline for applications for the inaugural <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/accelerator">CfA Accelerator</a> is rapidly approached (<strong>June 1</strong>). <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/accelerator/apply.html">Apply now: codeforamerica.org/accelerator</a></p>
