title: 'An Atypical Internship: Come Build CfA'
author: Abhi Nemani
author_login: Abhi
author_email: abhi@codeforamerica.org
excerpt: "Not sure why they're making me do this. It's kind of awkward, actually.
  See I was just an intern, like a week ago, and now they're asking me to recruit
  more interns. It's as if they are either saying, \"you need help\" or \"render yourself
  irrelevant.\" Either way, not sure what's in it for me, but I am sure that no matter
  what happens, I'm going to seem less interesting and less capable once the new crop
  comes on board. So here's to digging your own grave.\r\n\r\nNone of that, however,
  should detract you from considering joining the team. (I'm really not that threatening,
  so don't worry.) The CfA staff is small and new, and we've got a massive challenge
  ahead of us: in less than three months, 23 fellows will move into the office space
  we don't have yet, to build applications we're still figuring out. The phrase, \"getting
  in on the ground floor\" has real meaning here. We need you to help us build this
  organization.\r\n\r\n<strong>In particular, we're looking for developers, bloggers,
  researchers, and fundraisers.</strong> These roles may sound like typical internships
  you've seen or even had -- the kind where you're promised a meaningful impact, but
  end up getting coffee or worse, de-duping excel sheets. Trust me, this isn't your
  typical internship. You'll have autonomy, creative input, and responsibility. Lots
  of it. Plus, you'll get to work with a small, passionate, and (in most cases :))
  experienced team that'll rely on you to do more than you were asked. "

<p>Not sure why they’re making me do this. It’s kind of awkward, actually. See I was just an intern, like a week ago, and now they’re asking me to recruit more interns. It’s as if they are either saying, “you need help” or “render yourself irrelevant.” Either way, not sure what’s in it for me, but I am sure that no matter what happens, I’m going to seem less interesting and less capable once the new crop comes on board. So here’s to digging your own grave.</p>

<p>Find more information about the available roles below. Once you read them you’ll see why we need them filled immediately, so the deadline for submissions is soon — October 10, at midnight PT. If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to contact us at info@codeforamerica.org.</p>
<p>Interns need to commit to at least 10 hours of work a week, and should be in the Bay Area so they can come by the office to say hello from time to time. For passionate non-local applicants, however, we’re willing to make an exemption. While flexible, the unpaid Fall/Winter internship will run from October 21 through mid-March (think, around Spring Break).</p>
<p><strong>Apply now using the form below or here:<br/>

</strong><br/>
<strong>Developers<br/>
</strong>We need coders in all the major webby languages. Python, PHP, Ruby, .Net, Pearl and Java. You won’t be cleaning up other people’s sloppy html or tweaking our facebook page; rather, you’ll be standing up instances of existing open source applications and customizing them to meet our growing needs. You’ll work with our fellows, the CTO, and, well, me on projects like WordPress, AntHill, ThinkUp, Joget, Confluence, and a host of other interesting open source apps on cutting-edge cloud based services like Rackspace, Amazon, and others.</p>
<p><strong>Bloggers &amp; Researchers<br/>
</strong>As we build our apps, we’ll be building our own web presence as well. Over the past year, CfA has been thrilled to be part of the active and meaningful conversation taking place about the impact of technology on governance. As an intern, it would be your responsibility to help make us a leader in that discussion. This would involve researching stories, gathering data, drafting posts, seeking out cool technologies for review and generating other forms of content as well, ranging from graphics to videos — whatever would help us get our message of geeky public service out there.</p>
<p><strong>Development &amp; Outreach<br/>
</strong>Of course, none of that can happen unless we can pay the bills. As a non-profit, Code for America relies on the generous support of foundations, corporations, philanthropists, and anyone else willing to donate their money, time, or services. It’s a daily, challenging, and rewarding task reaching out to new donors. Since we hope and expect to grow (a lot) in the coming years, we’re going to need help tracking down leads, drafting grant applications, and reaching out to potential donors. It’s not an easy job, but when you do it, you earn the satisfaction of knowing that every dollar you bring it keeps our beautiful little experiment alive a little longer.</p>
