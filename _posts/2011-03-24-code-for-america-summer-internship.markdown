<p>Have the summer off and looking to make a difference? Code for America is now recruiting summer interns with the skills to take on big problems in a short timeline. Trust us, this isn’t your typical internship. You’ll have a core project which you’ll lead with autonomy, creative freedom, and responsibility. Lots of it. Plus, you’ll get to work with a small, passionate, and experienced team that’ll rely on you to have an impact. By the end of the summer, you’ll walk away with not only a new network of industry and civic leaders, but also with a finished product to point to and say, “I did that.”</p>
<p>The unpaid summer internship will feature an open government primer modeled off of our <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/the-2011-cfa-institute/">CfA Training</a>, as well as ongoing mentorship from our <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/2011-fellows/">fellows</a>, <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/about">staff</a>, and <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/who-we-are">board</a>. Working out of our San Francisco office, each intern will be given a project to focus on from their preferred track — code, design, or policy. <strong>Find more information <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/intern">here</a> and <a href="#app">apply now below</a>.</strong> The deadline for applications is April 15.</p>

<ul>
<li>Apps for Education. What apps would you build to get high school students more engaged in their education?</li>
<li>New Tools for a New Model. CfA is part incubator, part volunteer corps, so we need custom collaboration tools.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Redesign.Gov. Find a government website most in need of a redesign, and then make it look beautiful.</li>
<li>Civic Branding Guide. CfA will take on dozens of projects this year; how should they look and feel?</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4352" src="http://codeforamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/policy.png" title="design" width="610"/>
<ul>
<li>Civic Startups. New reseach is necessary on the business models and potential roadblocks for Gov 2.0 companies.  </li>
<li>Open Source Procurement. Governments are increasingly developing reusable code, but why aren’t they sharing?</li>
</ul>
