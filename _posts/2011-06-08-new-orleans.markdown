More than five years after the storm, neighborhood stakeholders in New Orleans have demonstrated an incredible capacity to contribute to the resilience of their neighborhoods.  Citizens keep close tabs on the properties in their area, and use their neighborhood information systems to deploy their limited, mostly volunteer, resources where they will make the most difference. They keep close watch for neighborhood properties coming up for public hearings, so neighbors can participate, and monitor neighborhood problems to make sure they do not fall through the cracks.

By developing a light-weight application to allow community stakeholders to submit bulk information to the city about their neighborhood, view existing relevant city data, and receive status for each of the on-going issues in their neighborhood, they will be better able to advocate and support their neighborhoods.
<h3>The Challenge</h3>
New Orleans is a finalist for the 2012 Code for America Fellowship, and if selected, it’ll be up to a team of CfA Fellows to take on this challenge. In less than a year, they’ll need to work with the city and our local partners to go from concept to delivery -- with everything from research and marketing to development and testing. Up for the challenge? We’re now accepting applications.
