<p>The back story:</p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-7209" height="389" src="http://codeforamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/badgerVSabhi.jpg" title="Badger vs. Abhi" width="300"/>In February, CfA Fellows gathered to discuss the branding of the organization, mostly just to orient ourselves to it. One of the ways I like to do this with any brand is to do a word association exercise. I like to start by writing down obvious words (government, technology, etc.) then move to related words, then finally abstract. In the abstract section I asked “what kind of animal would represent Code for America”? (Note: Youtube user czg123′s (aka Randall) had <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4r7wHMg5Yjg" target="_blank" title="Randall's Honey Badger Video">his vote</a> well documented already [NSFW].)</p>
<p>Badger was a crowd favorite (along with rabbit and panda to name a few). Over the last few months this discussion has become a bit of a hot topic among fellows and staff. <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/author/alan/" title="Alan Palazzolo">Alan Palazzolo</a> has even created a <a href="http://badgerpanda.codeforamerica.org" target="_blank" title="Badger vs. Panda">Badger vs. Panda voting system</a> to help highlight the overwhelming popularity of the badger mentality (eat cobras, take naps, “don’t give a…”) but was actually a study on online voting systems.</p>

<p>In conjunction with Alan’s app, I undertook a project to sculpt a 5″ Ben the Badger figurine that would finally put the debate to rest. Here’s what I have so far…</p>

We can then use a hi-res 3D printer to produce a master and then mold and produce replicas. I hope they are affordable enough so we can give them as a gift to our friends in the cities and as a token to remember our fellowship by.</p>
