<p><em>Editor’s Note: This is a guest post from Sybil Gurney, the Deputy Director of the Information Technology Department of the Alameda County Government.</em></p>
<p>Alameda County has joined the ranks of governments embracing the open government/open data movement. Backed by the Board of Supervisors, the Alameda County Data Sharing Initiative is in full swing. More than 80 datasets have been posted to the <a href="http://data.acgov.org">County’s data sharing website</a>, <a href="http://data.acgov.org">http://data.acgov.org</a>, and more are coming.</p>
<p>To promote our data sharing initiative, our commitment to open government, and our commitment to the community, we are having a hack-a-thon. The Alameda County Apps Challenge 2012 will take place on Saturday, December 8, at the Castro Valley Library. We got data and it is just begging to be used in a great app that benefits our community.</p>
<p>We want hackers, coders, programmers, citizens, activists, and anyone with good ideas to join us. Come to the hack-a-thon and make a difference! There are awesome prizes too!</p>
<p>There is one catch though; you have to register to attend. So, visit our website, <a href="http://code.acgov.org">http://code.acgov.org</a>, register, and join us on December 8.</p>
