<p><strong>8:00 am:</strong> People trickle in one by one.</p>
<p>A woman is starting a personal training business. She draws her floor plan on the back of a land use form. The city takes the plan though it is missing a dimension.</p>
<p>The municipal code is in a three ring binder. It and the GIS (mapping with information layered on top) are consulted regularly.</p>
<p><strong>10:00 am:</strong> There’s a one person wait.</p>
<p>A man wants to add a deck to his home. The GIS shows he is in a butterfly zone and will need to do a special survey. He is assured it’s not really a hurdle, so long as he doesn’t want to add a fireplace.</p>
<p><strong>11:45 am:</strong> Waiting room is full, people have to stand.</p>
<p>A real estate broker wants to know if a perspective buyer can build a garage, gazebo, or deck.</p>
<p>Graphic designer pays her zoning fee with a tastefully designed check.</p>
<p>Public hours are over.</p>
<p><strong>1:30 pm:</strong> Weekly staff meeting.</p>
<p>Carrot cake is served.</p>
<p>GIS and zoning info is projected on the wall as plans are dissected.</p>
<p>“The building was much cuter before. What happened?”<br/>
“It’s been value engineered before it’s even been approved.”<br/>
“Tell them we can’t approve it. It is not harmonious in form and proportion.”<br/>
<em>Laughter</em> followed by a plan to discuss code violations with the builder.</p>
<p>Twiddle = two-way left turn lane aka “Suicide lane”</p>
<p>“Signalize intersection” is said seven times and a planning angel gets their wings.</p>
<p> </p>
