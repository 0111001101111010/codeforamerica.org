<p>Code for America has been blessed with a fantastic group of dedicated individuals who have helped us get off the ground and guided our growth over the past couple of years.  As we’ve grown, we’ve recognized the need for our governing and strategy board to better reflect the community we serve and the principles we espouse.  I’m pleased to announce today three additions to the Code for America board of directors who help do just that.  Eric Ries, Nigel Jacob and Stacy Donohue have all graciously agreed to join our board.</p>

He’ll join Andrew Greenhill in the City of Tucson as two members of the board with deep experience with local government, and given all that we’ve learned from him, I’m looking forward to his continued influence on the organization.</p>

<p>Thank you to Stacy, Eric and Nigel for joining our efforts; I know they’ll help us take this idea as far as it can go.</p>
