It's the best kind of problem to have. We have received hundreds of applications for our <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/fellows">fellowship</a> -- hopefully even <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/apply">more</a> by our August 15 deadline -- and starting next week we will have to select just 20-25 fellows from that impressive pool for next year. Fortunately, we're going to have some help. Leaders from both the tech industry and government have agreed to help us review candidates and ensure we're getting the best people for the job. We are thrilled to have the input of such a diverse, experienced, and knowledgeable group:
