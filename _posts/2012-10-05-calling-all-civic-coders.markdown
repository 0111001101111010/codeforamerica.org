<p>The City of Philadelphia is one of the cities from across the country and around the world taking part in the <a href="https://developers.google.com/places/challenge/">Google Places API Developer Challenge</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="Philly Wants You!" height="251" src="http://codeforamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/iwantyou.jpeg" style="float: right; padding: 5px; margin-left: 10px;" width="201"/></p>
<p>And Philly wants you – yeah, you! – to help build an app through this developer challenge to connect Philadelphians to their government, and their community.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.phila.gov/mdo/phillyrising/">PhillyRising</a>, an initiative of the City’s Managing Director’s office, is built on the idea of collaboration – government collaborating with citizens and community leaders to improve the quality of life in city neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Philadelphia is now taking this idea of collaboration to the civic hacking community, calling on developers to help build a mobile application that can provide city residents with important information on their government and their neighborhoods.</p>
<p>The goal of the effort is to leverage the talents of the <a href="http://brigade.codeforamerica.org/">Code for America Brigade</a> and other passionate and talented Philadelphians to help realize the vision for a mobile app that supports the effort of the PhillyRising program.</p>
<p>The following video of City of Philadelphia Managing Director <a href="https://twitter.com/RichNegrin">Rich Negrin</a> provides more insight into what the city hopes to accomplish by reaching out to developers.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQA5chxwJIc"><img alt="City of Philadelphia Managing Director Rich Negrin describes the Philly Rising App" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17231" height="308" src="http://codeforamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/philly-rising.png" style="padding: 2px; border: 1px dashed black;" width="512"/></a></p>
<p>Additional information on the city’s app idea for the Google Challenge <a href="https://gist.github.com/3839996">can be found here</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://developers.google.com/places/documentation/">Google Places API</a> is a powerful resource to build location based apps, and to provide rich information on the places of interest in a city. Developers can pair this powerful resource with the data that Philadelphia has made available through the <a href="http://opendataphilly.org/">OpenDataPhilly.org</a> data portal and build an app that can change the face of a community.</p>
<p>Under the direction of the CfA Brigade in Philadelphia, a series of “hack nights” are being held at the <a href="http://devnuts.com/">Devnuts</a> hackerspace in Northern Liberties – every Tuesday night at 5:00 p.m. Eastern time starting on October 9 and running through the end of the month. Submissions to the Google Challenge are due by October 31.</p>
<p>In addition, the hope for this effort is that the app built for Philadelphia as part of the Google challenge will have broad applicability in cities across the country.</p>
<blockquote><p>“If we can develop this app in this way, and have it be such an important resource for connecting people with their government and each other…that can apply anywhere.”</p>
<p>– Rich Nergin, Deputy Mayor for Administration &amp; Managing Director, City of Philadelphia</p></blockquote>
<p>Building an app for Philadelphia is just the first step – the hope is to take this app to <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/2012/10/03/race-for-reuse/">every city with a CfA Brigade</a>.</p>
<p>Sign up for the <a href="https://developers.google.com/places/challenge/">Google Places API Developer Challenge</a> and help build the next great civic app – for Philadelphia, and beyond.</p>
