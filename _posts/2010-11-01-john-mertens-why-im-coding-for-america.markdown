Being a web developer, I am constantly trying to solve problems in the most efficient way possible. The flip side to this mindset is that I see inefficient or ineffective solutions all the time, usually stemming from improper use of technology or antiquated processes, or both. Participating in Code for America is a chance for me to use my skills to fix some of these flawed and ineffective processes in a direct, hands on manner.

I hate to sound like a cliche, but I also just want to give something back. I've been looking for a program like this for a few years and I am excited for the chance to participate.
