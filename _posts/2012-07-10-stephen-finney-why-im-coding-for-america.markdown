It was a journey in and of itself becoming an intern with Code for America. One might say that a series of coincidences led me to my internship here. However, I'm a firm believer that things happen for a reason. Dozens of things had to happen just right for me to be here, and I do not chalk them up to chance. I'm very excited about being here! So, armed with a purpose I intend to charge ahead into this summer with passion. Though it may sound irrelevant, I believe that the reader should know this about my time here.

Code for America is a unique organization. Of course, there are companies that work with the government on projects and others that develop open-source software. Some organizations even develop software for the government. However, I cannot think of any organization that even attempts what Code for America works to accomplish. I am privileged to give back to my community--and contribute to <em>many</em> communities--in such a unique way.

Code for America strives for integration between government (specifically cities) and its citizens. It seeks to combine citizenry and public policy in innovative ways that make public data accessible, increase government efficiency, and place more of the government's work in the people's hands. Code for America seeks to implement open data policies that will give citizens the power to interact with their city.

Here is Code for America's mission made simple: The goal is to unify the city and its citizens; to bring parts of the government that are not readily available or useful to the people, relevant and easy to access by working together.

The result is unique. The people of the city become intimately connected with their government and community and the discordance in their relationship with the community becomes more harmonious. They are given tools to interact with the community that they had never dreamed existed. They are given a purpose--a voice--that they had never known was available to them. The people's eyes are opened to the possibilities that arise when the government works <em>in unison</em> with its people. They believe that they matter, and in that realization, they act for the betterment of their entire community. The city then begins to work toward the citizen's benefit--and Code for America's mission becomes reality.

Code for America is about citizen-government collaboration.

It's about intelligently opening public data.

It's about working <em>for</em> the american people.

It's about a greater level of freedom and opportunity.

It is a worthy cause with a beautiful result...and that is why I'm Coding for America.
