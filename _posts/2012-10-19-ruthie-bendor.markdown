<p>Ruthie BenDor is a designer/developer who loves working where technology meets people. As a 2012 Code for America fellow, Ruthie partnered with the city of Santa Cruz, California to make it easier for entrepreneurs to start local businesses.</p>

<p>Before Code for America, Ruthie worked at the nonprofit organizations GLAD and MassEquality, consulted for a variety of companies and agencies, founded and ran a 100+ member user group for the ExpressionEngine CMS, and contributed to HTML5 Boilerplate and several other open source projects. Of all her past projects, she's most proud of CyclingCoder.com, where she spent summer 2011 riding her bicycle from Boston to San Francisco, interviewing people who work where government and technology converge along the way.</p>
