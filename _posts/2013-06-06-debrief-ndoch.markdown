More than 11,000 individuals were engaged in National Day of Civic Hacking through 95 events held in 83 cities. The stories are still coming in but we wanted to debrief and highlight some great stories that happened across the Code for America network last weekend.
<ul>
	<li>34 of the 95 NDoCH events were organized by Code for America's Brigades and Fellows.</li>
	<li>#hackforchange was a top U.S. trend on Twitter throughout the weekend.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.smartchicagocollaborative.org/moving-forward-after-national-day-of-civic-hacking/">Chicago had three events</a>, with more than 400 total participants.</li>
	<li>Mayors attended in cities such as San Diego, Calif., Louisville, Ken., and Palo Alto, Calif. <a href="http://codeforamerica.tumblr.com/image/51903693232">Sacramento's Mayor Kevin Johnson offered support via text</a>!</li>
	<li>Former U.S. CTO <a href="https://twitter.com/aneeshchopra/status/340857505112543232/photo/1">Aneesh Chopra attended Arlington's hackathon</a> organized by the Northern Virginia Brigade</li>
	<li>25 percent of <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ReWriteOak&amp;src=hash">ReWrite Oakland's</a> (Calif.) attendees were city employees</li>
	<li>#betaNYC hosted <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/2013/06/03/national-day-of-civic-hacking-report-back-from-nyc/">New York City's first CityCamp</a> through NYCBigApps</li>
	<li>Many new Brigades held their first events. Code for Summit County (Ohio) put on <a href="http://codeforsummitcounty.org/blog/2013/06/03/hackneo-success.html">HackNEO</a>, where 30 volunteers built two prototype applications</li>
	<li>Civic hackers across the country spoke about why civic coding is meaningful to them. Check out these videos from <a href="http://codeforamerica.tumblr.com/post/52243453192/code-for-sacramento-how-civic-hacking-helps-our">Sacramento, Calif.</a>, <a href="http://codeforamerica.tumblr.com/post/52243474905/miami-florida-had-its-very-first-civic-hackathon">Miami</a>, <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/codeforamerica.org/file/d/0B7VEtIh4x2-_Uy02bUpxSmFBaEU/edit">Asheville, N.C.</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0-61-ggYy1ql-46pKOIAAkUq5x6slZoB">Minnesota</a>, <a href="http://codeforamerica.tumblr.com/post/52057229767/frank-webber-a-hack4colorado-participant-tells-us">Colorado</a></li>
	<li>Cross city collaboration took place across the country. Philadelphia and Baltimore tested out apps developed in the each other's city. Boston redeployed Councilmatic, which was started at a RHoK/CfA event several years ago in Philadelphia.</li>
	<li>From the USDA blog: "The “Farmers Feed Us” app tied into existing social media sites to let vendors notify shoppers when they’re at a market, what they’re selling that day, etc.  It won the <a href="http://daveizm.tumblr.com/image/51925910227">top, foodie-friendly prize at the Hack for Food event</a>.  Their <a href="https://github.com/aaronkai/farmers_market">code is also available online</a>.</li>
</ul>
