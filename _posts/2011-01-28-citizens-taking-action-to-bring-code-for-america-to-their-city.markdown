<p>Last month we asked residents across America to take action and bring Code for America to their cities through our <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/cities/citizen-action-center/">Citizen Action Center.</a> Well, they certainly did! We have over 60 cities represented on our <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/cities/citizen-action-center/">map</a>, that means people like you in towns throughout the country sent the tweet<a href="http://twitter.com/?status=I%20want%20my%20city%20to%20@CodeforAmerica:%20http://bit.ly/city-action"> “I want [my city] to @CodeforAmerica”</a>. This action not only put your city on the map, it sent a message to government officials that you believe government can work better and that you want Code for America to help provide a new kind of solution to solving problems in your city.</p>

</a>We’ve heard you loud and clear, and so have government employees in Baltimore, New York City, Chandler, Detroit, Memphis, and many other cities that have contacted me because you brought Code for America to their attention.</p>
<p>This is powerful stuff! Let’s boost the momentum and sprint over the next three weeks to double the number of cities on our map (yes we want 120!). If your city is already on the map, make it the leader in tweets. To date, New York City is in the lead with 6 tweets, followed by San Francisco, Lexington, Atlanta and Detroit with 4 tweets each.</p>
<p>I want to hear from government officials in your city! Go to our Citizen Action Center and take action to bring Code for America to your city in 2012. If you want more information about the program, be sure to attend our<a href="http://codeforamerica.org/2012-city-webinar"> upcoming webinar on February 8</a>. City Application deadline is March 1, 2011 so let’s hustle and <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/cities/citizen-action-center/">spread the word</a> quickly.</p>
