<p>Joel brings Monster downstairs so we have enough computers.</p>
<p>Eddie installs a 30 day trial version of Adobe Illustrator on his machine so we have enough computers running Illustrator.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youthradio.org/" target="_blank">Youth Radio</a> arrives.</p>
<p>Youth Radio has started a <a href="http://mobileapplab.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">branch</a> that is trying to teach young people how to design Apps. Their first App is called <a href="http://mobileapplab.wordpress.com/2011/03/05/forage-city/" target="_blank">Forage City</a>. It’s a tool that helps redistribute excess produce to people in need.</p>
<p>Everyone eyes the fruit. We tell them it is not for eating… yet.</p>
<p>Alicia offers beverages.<br/>
Somebody asks “Do you have soda?”</p>
<p>Introductions.<br/>
Dante, Isaiah, Kenny, and Kristina are high school students from Oakland. We tell them to each grab a computer.</p>
<p>Kenny calls dibs on Monster.</p>
<p>Alicia explains the difference between an icon and a logo.<br/>
She shows the oldest copyrighted logo :</p>

<p>Names of fruits have been written on slips of paper, folded up and placed into a salad spinner. Everybody picks a paper and starts to draw the fruit they chose.</p>
<p>Alicia tells me she feels bad for giving the students Sprite.</p>
<p>Pencils are switched for the pen tool of Adobe Illustrator.</p>
<p>Anchor points and bézier curves are explained.</p>
<p>Kristina’s making Lemons. Kenny is drawing an avocado. Isaiah has moved on from a plum to a cherry, and Dante is tackling corn.</p>
<p>The fruit is eaten.</p>
