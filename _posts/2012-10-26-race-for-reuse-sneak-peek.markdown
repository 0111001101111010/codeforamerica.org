<p>We thought you’d be interested to know a little about the submissions we’re <a href="https://codeforamerica.wufoo.com/forms/race-for-reuse-submission/" title="submission form">receiving</a> for the <a href="http://brigade.codeforamerica.org/pages/race-for-reuse" title="Campaign home">Race for Reuse</a> campaign. Apps that are <a href="https://codeforamerica.wufoo.com/forms/race-for-reuse-submission/" title="submission form">submitted to us</a> by November 6 (Election Day) will be featured in national and local campaigns for civic engagement.</p>
<p>We’re aiming to redeploy 20 new instances of civic apps for engagement. <a href="http://commons.codeforamerica.org/apps/localwiki" title="commons page about localwiki">LocalWikis</a> and <a href="http://commons.codeforamerica.org/apps/adopt-hydrant" title="commons page about adopta">Adopt-a-Hydrants</a> are the most popular among new instances that are already live, at five and three respectively. At least two existing instances of Adopt-a — <a href="http://sirens.honolulu.gov" title="Honolulu sirens">Honolulu</a> (tsunami sirens) and <a href="http://adoptahydrant.org" title="adoptahydrant.org">Boston</a> (fire hydrants) will be included in the engagement campaign. No new instances of <a href="http://commons.codeforamerica.org/apps/shareabouts" title="commons page on shareabouts">Shareabouts</a> or <a href="http://commons.codeforamerica.org/apps/textizen" title="commons page on textizen">Textizen</a> have been submitted early. We’re tracking a few groups who are actively working new applications of these tools to local issues. <a href="http://kgcl.org/community/" title="king's grant community league">My neighborhood</a> is considering Shareabouts as a tool for communicating about the locations of traffic signs on neighborhood roads. More instances of LocalWiki and Adopt-a should be online soon, too.</p>
<p>I’m surprised not to see more early action for Textizen. It’s so easy and effective. All it takes is a motivated group to demonstrate it for their city. Is your city talking about important public transportation issues? <a href="http://www.textizen.com/welcome" title="textizen home">Create a Textizen poll</a> to get input from riders while they ride.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://adopt-a-hydrant-providence.herokuapp.com/" title="providence instance">Providence</a>, R.I.; <a href="http://adopt-a-hydrant-syracuse.herokuapp.com/" title="syracuse instance">Syracuse</a>, N.Y.; and <a href="http://adopt-a-hydrant-banff.herokuapp.com/" title="banff instance">Banff</a>, Alberta, Canada folks from city government are already engaged with us in the campaign and welcome participation from their local communities with Adopt-a-Hydrant. Please <a href="mailto:adopta@codeforamerica.org?subject=I want to volunteer for Adopta in my city" title="email brigade-info">contact us</a> if you live in one of these cities and want to volunteer for Adopt-a-Hydrant. We want local help for the local campaign and to adopt hydrants.</p>
<p>LocalWikis are live in <a href="http://detroitwiki.org/" title="detroit instance">Detroit</a>, <a href="http://oaklandwiki.org/" title="oakland instance">Oakland</a>, Calif., <a href="http://seattlewiki.net" title="seattle instance">Seattle</a>, <a href="http://saltlakewiki.org" title="salt lake city instance">Salt Lake City</a> and <a href="http://wiki.openatlanta.net" title="atlanta instance">Atlanta</a>. The founders of LocalWiki and the national LocalWiki organizers community are already coaching the new organizers. Please <a href="mailto:brigade-info@codeforamerica.org?subject=I%20want%20to%20volunteer%20for%20LocalWiki%20in%20my%20city" title="email brigade-info">contact us</a> if you live in one of these cities and want to volunteer for LocalWiki. We want local help for the local campaign and to “edit your city.”</p>
<p>After this election season lets show ourselves and each other that citizens are more than ready to work together on ordinary civic issues that need our collective attention.</p>
