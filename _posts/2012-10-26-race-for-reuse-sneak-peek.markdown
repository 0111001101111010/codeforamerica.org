We thought you'd be interested to know a little about the submissions we're <a title="submission form" href="https://codeforamerica.wufoo.com/forms/race-for-reuse-submission/">receiving</a> for the <a title="Campaign home" href="http://brigade.codeforamerica.org/pages/race-for-reuse">Race for Reuse</a> campaign. Apps that are <a title="submission form" href="https://codeforamerica.wufoo.com/forms/race-for-reuse-submission/">submitted to us</a> by November 6 (Election Day) will be featured in national and local campaigns for civic engagement.

We're aiming to redeploy 20 new instances of civic apps for engagement. <a title="commons page about localwiki" href="http://commons.codeforamerica.org/apps/localwiki">LocalWikis</a> and <a title="commons page about adopta" href="http://commons.codeforamerica.org/apps/adopt-hydrant">Adopt-a-Hydrants</a> are the most popular among new instances that are already live, at five and three respectively. At least two existing instances of Adopt-a -- <a title="Honolulu sirens" href="http://sirens.honolulu.gov">Honolulu</a> (tsunami sirens) and <a title="adoptahydrant.org" href="http://adoptahydrant.org">Boston</a> (fire hydrants) will be included in the engagement campaign. No new instances of <a title="commons page on shareabouts" href="http://commons.codeforamerica.org/apps/shareabouts">Shareabouts</a> or <a title="commons page on textizen" href="http://commons.codeforamerica.org/apps/textizen">Textizen</a> have been submitted early. We're tracking a few groups who are actively working new applications of these tools to local issues. <a title="king's grant community league" href="http://kgcl.org/community/">My neighborhood</a> is considering Shareabouts as a tool for communicating about the locations of traffic signs on neighborhood roads. More instances of LocalWiki and Adopt-a should be online soon, too.

I'm surprised not to see more early action for Textizen. It's so easy and effective. All it takes is a motivated group to demonstrate it for their city. Is your city talking about important public transportation issues? <a title="textizen home" href="http://www.textizen.com/welcome">Create a Textizen poll</a> to get input from riders while they ride.

In <a title="providence instance" href="http://adopt-a-hydrant-providence.herokuapp.com/">Providence</a>, R.I.; <a title="syracuse instance" href="http://adopt-a-hydrant-syracuse.herokuapp.com/">Syracuse</a>, N.Y.; and <a title="banff instance" href="http://adopt-a-hydrant-banff.herokuapp.com/">Banff</a>, Alberta, Canada folks from city government are already engaged with us in the campaign and welcome participation from their local communities with Adopt-a-Hydrant. Please <a title="email brigade-info" href="mailto:adopta@codeforamerica.org?subject=I want to volunteer for Adopta in my city">contact us</a> if you live in one of these cities and want to volunteer for Adopt-a-Hydrant. We want local help for the local campaign and to adopt hydrants.

LocalWikis are live in <a title="detroit instance" href="http://detroitwiki.org/">Detroit</a>, <a title="oakland instance" href="http://oaklandwiki.org/">Oakland</a>, Calif., <a title="seattle instance" href="http://seattlewiki.net">Seattle</a>, <a title="salt lake city instance" href="http://saltlakewiki.org">Salt Lake City</a> and <a title="atlanta instance" href="http://wiki.openatlanta.net">Atlanta</a>. The founders of LocalWiki and the national LocalWiki organizers community are already coaching the new organizers. Please <a title="email brigade-info" href="mailto:brigade-info@codeforamerica.org?subject=I%20want%20to%20volunteer%20for%20LocalWiki%20in%20my%20city">contact us</a> if you live in one of these cities and want to volunteer for LocalWiki. We want local help for the local campaign and to "edit your city."

After this election season lets show ourselves and each other that citizens are more than ready to work together on ordinary civic issues that need our collective attention.
