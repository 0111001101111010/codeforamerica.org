<p>At a few weeks into the development of the Brigade program a status summary becomes useful. Here is what has happened thus far:</p>
<ol>
<li>We connected with civic hacker communities throughout the country. More cities join weekly. These “alpha” cities have agreed to work together to develop the first iteration of the Brigade program.</li>
<li>A <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/codeforamerica.org/group/brigade-dev/topics" target="_blank" title="forum home on Google Groups">forum</a> was established for discussion of program and platform development. Forum membership is moderated, and all discussion is visible to the general public.</li>
<li>We talked to the creators and maintainers of apps that we’ll adopt and deploy during the alpha program. Apps include <a href="http://marketplace.civiccommons.org/apps/adopt-hydrant" target="_blank" title="adopt-a-hydrant in the marketplace">Adopta</a>, <a href="https://github.com/codeforamerica/public_art_finder" target="_blank" title="Public Art Finder on CfA github">Foo Mapper</a>, <a href="https://github.com/azavea/Open-Data-Catalog" target="_blank" title="Open Data Catalog on Azavea's github">Open Data Catalog</a>, and <a href="http://marketplace.civiccommons.org/apps/pdxapi" target="_blank" title="PDXAPI on Civic Commons Marketplace">PDXAPI</a>. Each of these have demonstrated viability and sustainability for the cities in which they have been used.</li>
<li>CfA staff participated in an inception event facilitated by <a href="http://pivotallabs.com/users/parker/profile" target="_blank" title="Parker's Bio at Pivotal">Parker Thompson</a> of <a href="http://pivotallabs.com/" target="_blank" title="Pivotal Labs home page">Pivotal Labs</a>. The eight hour session generated the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AsosB28mzLF6dEVKNHRKUXRhbmlyVEV4THdHN29BN1E" target="_blank" title="User stories spreadsheet in Google Docs">product design</a> for the Brigade’s web platform.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/codeforamerica.org/group/brigade-dev/browse_thread/thread/cf77d7c98c9edf55" title="Google group call info &amp; agenda">first call among alpha cities</a> was held on Friday, January 20.</li>
</ol>
<p>On the horizon: Fellows will host events in each of their cities on February 25. We are targeting this date for simultaneous Brigade events. Contact <a href="mailto:jack@codeforamerica.org" target="_blank" title="email Jack Madans">Jack Madans</a> to participate where you live.</p>
