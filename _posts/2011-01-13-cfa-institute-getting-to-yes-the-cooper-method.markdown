excerpt: It's been a lively, intense and passionate two days at Code for America!
  This week is all about the process of 'Getting to Yes.' We invited speakers who
  have repeatable processes, methods and skills they use to bring successful products
  to market.  Code for America is part fellowship program, part traditional client-vendor relationship
  management, and part culture change.  In all of those elements, consensus is key,
  especially in government.  How do we build it in cities?

On Tuesday, we invited interaction designers, Jim Dibble and Suzy Thompson from <a href="http://www.cooper.com">Cooper</a>, a design and strategy firm based in San Francisco. Cooper is famous for their use of user research interviews, personas, and scenarios in order to design products that people love to use.  Their clients include Adobe, Flip, 3m and a host of Fortune 500 companies as well as foundations and government agencies.

Founder Alan Cooper and Cooper alum Kim Goodwin have written books that define the interaction design space, including: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Designing-Digital-Age-Human-Centered-Products/dp/0470229101/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1279145136&amp;sr=1-1">Designing for the Digital Age: How to Create Human-Centered Products and Services</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/About-Face-Essentials-Interaction-Design/dp/0470084111/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1279145077&amp;sr=1-1">About Face 3: The Essentials of Interaction Design</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Inmates-Are-Running-Asylum-Products/dp/0672326140/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1279145118&amp;sr=1-1">The Inmates Are Running the Asylum: Why High Tech Products Drive Us Crazy and How to Restore the Sanity</a>.



During the day-long donated training, Jim and Suzy covered elements of the Cooper approach, including:

<ol>

	<li>Determine user context and goals</li>

	<li>Interview techniques and approaches</li>

	<li>Listening techniques</li>

	<li>Synthesizing user interviews</li>

	<li>Creating personas</li>

	<li>Defining scenarios</li>

	<li>Extracting user requirements</li>

</ol>

Each of our city teams will use a modified version of the approach, including interviewing 100 'users', to build consensus, find initial alpha users and reach as many city staff as possible during the month of February.  We want to build a culture of yes by enrolling users, stakeholders and citizens in the ideation, building and approval process.  Thank you to Cooper for bringing a repeatable, user-centered design focus to CfA and our projects!
