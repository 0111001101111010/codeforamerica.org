<h1>What is it?</h1>
<p>By now readers of this blog have likely heard of National Day of Civic Hacking, a.k.a., Hack for Change (<a href="http://hackforchange.org">hackforchange.org</a>). The announcement from The White House received a boost of attention in online media. If you missed it <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=national+day+of+civic+hacking">search?q=national+day+of+civic+hacking</a>.</p>
<p>National Day of Civic Hacking means different things to different people. This is by design because there is no one way to civic hack. People all over hack code, hack hardware, hack physical space, hack policy, and hack civic hacking.  <em>Common among all points of view is an acknowledgement and celebration of the meaningful work that civic innovators do every day.</em> National Day of Civic Hacking is about people. It is a brief moment to recognize achievements, show off good works, and connect with civic hackers who are using their skills to make our cities and this country great.</p>
<p>Response to National Day of Civic Hacking has been overwhelming. As of this writing there are <strong>80 events planned in 67 locations across 35 states and territories</strong>. Not all National Day of Civic Hacking events will be affiliated with Code for America. The Brigade is just <a href="http://hackforchange.org/events.html">one several ways</a> people can plug in to what’s happening all around the country. The event’s lead organizer, <a href="http://secondmuse.com">Second Muse</a> is the group behind Random Hacks of Kindness (<a href="http://rhok.org">RHoK.org</a>). Their hack-a-thons model is another way to get involved. Some events, like those modeled after <a href="http://www.superhappy.be/">Super Happy Block Party</a> are intended to be street fairs with celebrations of tech, music, and art. The Hack for Change site also has an open invitation to propose other event or activity models. Personally, I’d like to see more urban prototypers, place hackers and makers seize the initiative to get organized.</p>
<h1>Plugging in through Brigade<img alt="" class="alignright" height="240" src="http://codeforamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/brigade_circle.png" width="240"/></h1>
<p>Joining up with your local Brigade is one way to participate in National Day of Civic Hacking. Like any Brigade activity, captains and organizers will host formatted <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/16CSiN809nNUksFYiQIpxzxHEhPZRAa_WpGA4DZ9upmc/edit?usp=sharing">events</a> and structured <a href="http://brigade.codeforamerica.org/pages/activities">activities</a> where they live. My personal favorite is “Civic Tech Expo”, an event I first heard about from <a href="http://codefortulsa.org/">Code for Tulsa</a> organizer <a href="http://brigade.codeforamerica.org/members/104">Luke Crouch</a>. I think National Day of Civic Hacking is a great opportunity to show off your hard work from the throughout the year. Brigade Support Team will try to come up with a couple of EZ activities specially designed for National Day of Civic Hacking. Adding tags in your GitHub commits to your open source, civic code repositories is one easy way to show support. With a little time and ingenuity maybe we can fire up the ol’ Arduino-driven Liberty Bell that rings off commit hooks! That would be fun. Local organizers and participants will determine which events and activities to organize. We’ve heard from locations hosting <em>Brigade Meetups, Civic Tech Expos, Hack Nights, and Write-a-thons</em>. Plans need not be elaborate or drawn out to be meaningful. <a href="http://brigade.codeforamerica.org/events">Most brigades are civic hacking week in and week out.</a> I encourage already-active Brigades to think seriously about how National Day of Civic Hacking aligns with and supports your ongoing mission. Maybe you’ll move your weekly hack night to the weekend and keep working on those projects. Maybe you’ll host the greatest civic tech expo your city has every seen. You know best what works where you live.</p>
<h2>Stay connected</h2>
<p>Like other Brigade events, we’ll publish a web page where you can find all the information about what we are all doing during National Day of Civic Hacking. If there isn’t a Brigade event organized near you then please learn about Brigade’s leadership programs to understand what it takes to start forming a local Brigade and watch out for those <a href="http://brigade.codeforamerica.org/pages/opensource">activities that let you participate from most anywhere</a>. Communicate with other local organizers in Brigade’s forums. I encourage you to Tumbl pictures, stories, quotes, and commentary – the <a href="http://codeforamerica.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Code for America Tumblr</a> is your forum, lend your voice.  Use the #hackforchange, #civichacking and #cfabrigade tags.</p>
<p>Personally, I think National Day of Civic Hacking should be celebration and display of the good work that is done by volunteers like you, who are contributing when it’s <em>not</em> National Day of Civic Hacking. I see your work every day and I want everyone to see it for at least one day…or two :^)</p>
