We know there’s lots of talent waiting to get involved all across the country, and we need you to help us find them. </p>
<p>You can do something as simple as a tweet or as fun as a party — we’ve even put together <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/spread-the-word">some tools</a> to make it easy for you to make some noise, get some local support, tap your friends, and even bring people together.</p>
