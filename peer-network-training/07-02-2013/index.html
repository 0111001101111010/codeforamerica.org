## About

Procurement is frequently cited as one of the biggest barriers to government innovation. But in Philadelphia, they’ve been taking steps to turn that around — experimenting with creative workarounds to the process like posting RFPs on Github and creating a central, startup-friendly portal that lists select opportunities to contract with the city. And though still early stage, the preliminary results have been promising.
Join this conversation with Mark Headd, Chief Data Officer for the City of Philadelphia, who has been heading up many of these efforts. In this webinar, Mark will share how he did it, what the results were, and how other cities can borrow these strategies.

This session originally aired July 2, 2013.
