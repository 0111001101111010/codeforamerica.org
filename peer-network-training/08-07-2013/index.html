                <h4>About</h4>
                <p>How can cities effectively collaborate with a local civic hacker community? In Raleigh, North Carolina, local civic technologists from inside government and out have partnered to build an active Code for America Brigade: a volunteer group of civic geeks organizing civic innovation and technology as well as civic-minded community efforts in Raleigh to advance the open government and open data movements. Part of what has made their initiative so successful is the strong partnership between leaders from within local government and local developers.</p>
                
<p>Join this conversation with Chad Foley, and Jason Hibbets, co-captains of the Raleigh Brigade. Chad works for the City of Raleigh IT Department, and Jason is a project manager at RedHat -- but in their spare time, they're both civic hackers. Learn how they've built a strong working relationship and spurred collaboration between city hall and the local developer community, working towards the common goal of making Raleigh a better place to live and work.</p>
