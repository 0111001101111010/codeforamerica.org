                <h3><strong>Government Programs</strong></h3>

                <p><em>"One of the big things about CfA is that it gives people whose motivation is to serve the public, a reminder of why they're here and a chance to talk to other people. You couldn't do Code for America if every city was its own lab. The fact that there's a shared training group, meetings where people talk to each other, cross talk, and that ability to meet others who are excited about the same things you're excited about -- that's a big part of what powers Code for America"</em> - Clay Shirky, Author</p>
                
                <p>“Open Data is critical to any strong government. The data belongs to the people. It needs to be open the from top level data all the way down into reports -- not just for the people who already know what's going on, but also for entrepreneurs to create opportunities and offer information and knowledge to the public. We have a standing executive order for all data to be open.”</em>  - Mayor Greg Fisher, City of Louisville</p>
                
               <p><em>"Code for America provides an ideal forum for discussion on developing standards and municipal data, and members benefit from the efforts taking place across the country to make open data more useful and more powerful."</em> - Mark Headd, Chief Data Officer, City of Philadelphia</p>
               
               <p><em>"Peer Network members benefit from the efforts taking place across the country to make open data more useful and more powerful."</em> - Mark Headd, Philadelphia's Chief Data Officer</p>

                <h3><strong>Fellowship Program</strong></h3>

                <p><em>“It’s hard in any business, or government for that matter, to pull out dedicated resources just to focus on innovation, so this is an intentional way to do that.”</em> - Mayor Greg Fischer, City of Louisville, KY</p>
                
                <p><em>"The Code for America project, in partnership with the two Kansas Cities, will further elevate this region into a major driver and competitor in the field of entrepreneurialism, innovation and technology; making the region even more attractive to businesses.”</em> - Mayor Joe Reardon, Kansas City, KS</p>

<p><em>“The projects that they developed are transforming thousands of Detroiters lives, right now. This has been one of the most incredible experiences in my professional career.”</em> - Karla Henderson, Group Executive of Planning and Facilities, City of Detroit, MI</p>

<p><em>“The last person you want to ask is the person who works in the government. They’re the fish in the fish tank. They don’t see the water. The hallmark of all Code for America projects is, what is the user experience? How does it work? And is it inefficient or ineffective in some way?”</em> - Ted Smith, Director of the Department of Economic Growth and Innovation, City of Louisville, KY</p>

<p><em>“Code for America pioneered the approach of building a community of citizen entrepreneurs who could harness the transformative power of technology to address challenges faced by local governments.”</em> - Chris Vein, Deputy Chief Technology Officer for Government Innovation, The White House</p>

<p><em>“It’s about inserting a model of working, thinking, innovating into a culture that’s bound by our rules. It’s a kind of culture virus for innovation in government.”</em> - John Tolva, Former Chief Technology Officer, City of Chicago, IL</p>

<p><em>“Code for America is not just about creating a bunch of apps. It’s connecting our citizens with our city.”</em>  - Amanda Deaton, Assistant Chief Administrative Officer, City of Macon, GA</p>

<p><em>“When you bring in a group of Fellows from Code for America, I would put them on the hardest problem you’ve got...They were able to solve an intractable problem for us.”</em> - Allen Square, Chief Information Officer, City of New Orleans, LA</p>

<p><em>“CfA has transformed the way I think about getting things accomplished in the public space. It’s introduced new concepts - of government as a platform, and lean startup - that, as a 20 years inside the bureaucracy government practitioner, have really changed the way I think about the work that I do.”</em> - Jeff Friedman, Co-Director of the Mayor’s Office of New Urban Mechanics, City and County of Philadelphia, PA</p>

<p><em>“As society grows more connected, the challenge for local leaders is to use that technology and social media to better inform and engage communities...We believe Code has tremendous potential to unlock the imaginations of thousands of citizens to improve lives all over America.”</em> - Damian Thorman, Former National Program Director, The John S. and James L. Knight Foundation</p>

<p><em>“This process, more than the apps, is what’s really cool. Opening the government up and working with the community – getting their buy-in – has been a game changer.”</em> - Forest Frizzell, Deputy Director for the Department of IT, City and County of Honolulu, HI</p>

<p><em>“One of the best parts about us being there was working with different people in the city. People that I didn’t even know were emailing the fire department saying ‘I’m so glad this exists.’”</em> - Emily Wright Moore, 2012 Code for America Fellow in City of Austin, TX</p>

<p><em>“I think the main legacy that we leave behind in Detroit is that these things are possible...Now people realize that by opening up data, other people can step up and build things that the city can’t afford to, and that people can benefit from data that sometimes seems mundane.”</em> - Prashant Singh, 2012 Code for America Fellow in City of Detroit, MI</p>

<p><em>"Andrew and Ariel have been incredibly important resources for our region and the impact of their work will be felt long after this project wraps up. One of my top priorities as mayor is ensuring that city government is a conduit for success and prosperity and is not a paperwork impediment.  The fellows Andrew and Ariel have definitely helped move that priority forward."</em> - Mayor Sly James, Kansas City</p>

                <h3><strong>Startup Program</strong></h3>
                <p><em>"We’re launched in Texas, which is 1/12 of the American population. Code for America helped make the connections we will need to expand our service to the rest of the country and we’re on track to do it in 2013.”</em> - Erine Gray, Founder and CEO of Aunt Bertha</p>
                
                <p><em>"I've been amazed by how quickly things have taken off since joining Code for America. An API can be difficult to explain because it's invisible and unknown to those who benefit the most, but our mentors at Code for America have shared some ingenious ideas that have had a dramatic and immediate impact. Needless to say, we are reluctant graduates. We'd do it again if we could."</em> - Frank Chien, Co-Founder of LearnSprout</p>
                
                <p><em>"The Code for America Accelerator has been invaluable. It’s introduced us to experienced mentors who have helped us create a world-class product. We’ve also been able to get feedback on our product from dozens of people working in government throughout the country."</em>- Jed Sundwall, Co-Founder of Measured Voice</p>
                
                <p><em>“From Captricity’s early days, we thought that the technology’s ability to capture and digitize data from paper forms would be extremely useful in governments. However, we knew very little about how governments worked and had no contacts in the civic space. Code for America has given us the knowledge, understanding, and contacts we need to better support the work of civic leaders across the country.”</em>- Kuang Chen, CEO of Captricity</p>
                
                <p><em>“MindMixer is thrilled to be working with Code for America as we share their passion to improve the way citizens communicate and interact with their government.”</em>- MindMixer CEO, Nick Bowden</p>
                
                <p><em>"A disaster touches everyone in the community, and believe that everyone should be able to participate in the recovery effort. But to be able to do so safely, efficiently, and effectively, they need tools and marching orders. We've built our platform specifically for people who aren't prepared to manage resources. Code for America has helped us refine these tools, and deliver them to preparing communities. In just a few months, they've taken us from goodhearted idea, to technology company."</em>- Caitria O'Neill, CEO of Recovers</p>
                
                <p><em>“Code for America is inspiring a government innovation movement and as part of that is working with Revelstone to ensure citizens are living in efficient and well-run cities and towns.  The CfA Accelerator has helped to turbo-charge our business with advice, national awareness, introductions to the technology elite of Silicon Valley and nurturing potential investment opportunities.”</em> - Ken Wolf, CEO of Revelstone</p>
                
                <p><em>“As a parole officer working with ex-offenders, it can be exceptionally difficult to find resources. Aunt Bertha has been a great tool that allows people to find help for themselves and often, support their family’s needs as well!”</em>- Erin McGann, Texas Department of Criminal Justice</p>
                
                <p><em>“I have been involved in both the philanthropic and delivery side of social services for over 30 years. Nothing has come close to Aunt Bertha's solution-based ideas and implementation.”</em> - Sara Speer Selber, Former CEO of AIDS Foundation Houston</p>
                
                <p><em>“There is a gold mine of this important information which is virtually impossible to really use because it’s on paper, or at best, scans of paper forms. Captricity unlocks that data and allows us to offer it to the public in a digital, machine-readable format.  It allows us to further our mission and keep the public genuinely more informed.”</em>- Ann Ravel, Commission Chair of the Fair Political Practices Commission of California</p>
                
                <p><em>"LearnSprout took just a few minutes to set up and eliminated the hassle of integrating with our PowerSchool student information system. It's been refreshingly simple and reliable."</em>- Mike Teng, Director of Instructional Technology at Rocketship Education</p>
                
                <p><em>“The MindMixer site has been incredible for the City of Omaha and its citizens. In the first 24 hours of the site being live, we received more ideas than we had in the previous year of the Mayor’s administration."</em> -- Nikola Jordan, Deputy Director for the mayor of Omaha</p>
                
                <p><em>“We are convinced the Revelstone strategy of organizing, storing, and sharing data with so many communities will be extremely valuable to mayors across the country.  The platform’s benchmarking capabilities are advantageous to elected officials because it allows them to provide residents with a clear explanation about why a certain change makes sense both financially and in terms of benefits to the entire community.  Any time an elected official can relate empirical statistical data to residents it provides a factual and historical rationale for why any type of change or project makes sense, and that the decision was not indiscriminately reached on a whim.”</em> - Dave Fried, Mayor of the Robbinsville, New Jersey Township</p>
