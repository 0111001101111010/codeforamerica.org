                  The mission of Code for America is to help governments work better for everyone with the people <br> 
                  and the power of the web. Through our Fellowship, Accelerator, Brigade, and Peer Network we are<br> 
                  building a network of cities, citizens, community groups, and startups, all equally committed to<br>
                  reimagining government for the 21st century.<br>
