                  The mission of Code for America is to help governments work better for everyone with the people <br> 
                  and the power of the web. Through our Fellowship, Accelerator, Brigade, and Peer Network we are<br> 
                  building a network of cities, citizens, community groups, and startups, all equally committed to<br>
                  reimagining government for the 21st century.<br>

                  <b>Code for America is looking for a Development Intern</b>
                  <br>
                  Over the past four years, Code for America has grown from a small team with a big idea to an international<br> 
                  network of thousands. As we expand, weâ€™re committed to diversifying our revenue streams and finding new sources<br>
                  of funding. That's why Code for America is looking for a Development Intern.<br>
                  <br>
                  As a Development Intern you will have the opportunity to work for a nonprofit tech startup at the forefront<br> 
                  of civic innovation with reach across the world, and capitalize on that influence while honing your analytical,<br> 
                  research and communication skills. You will learn the strategies and tactics of a successful fundraising program<br> 
                  that includes institutional, corporate and individual donors and understand the way in which the fundraising team<br> 
                  collaborates with internal program and technology teams and external partners. This is a great chance to develop<br> 
                  real-world skills while growing your network with innovative individuals and organizations across the country.<br>
                  <br>
