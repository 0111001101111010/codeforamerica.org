                  The mission of Code for America is to help governments work better for everyone with the people <br> 
                  and the power of the web. Through our Fellowship, Accelerator, Brigade, and Peer Network we are<br> 
                  building a network of cities, citizens, community groups, and startups, all equally committed to<br>
                  reimagining government for the 21st century.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Code for America is looking for a Development Intern</b><br>
                  <br>
                  Over the past four years, Code for America has grown from a small team with a big idea to an<br> 
                  international network of thousands. As we expand, we’re committed to diversifying our revenue <br> 
                  streams and finding new sources of funding. That's why Code for America is looking for a<br> 
                  Development Intern.<br>
                  <br>
                  As a Development Intern you will have the opportunity to work for a nonprofit tech startup at the<br> 
                  forefront of civic innovation with reach across the world, and capitalize on that influence while<br> 
                  honing your analytical, research and communication skills. You will learn the strategies and tactics <br> 
                  of a successful fundraising program that includes institutional, corporate and individual donors and <br> 
                  understand the way in which the fundraising team collaborates with internal program and technology<br> 
                  teams and external partners. This is a great chance to develop real-world skills while growing your<br> 
                  network with innovative individuals and organizations across the country.<br>
                  <br>
                  You will be responsible for helping to develop Code for America’s grassroots fundraising strategy<br> 
                  which will include learning about the existing program, researching other programs to glean new ideas<br>
                  and understand industry best practices and make recommendations to Senior Staff about the best path<br> 
                  to move forward on grassroots fundraising. Successful candidates will have an interest in the<br> 
                  intersection of tech and public policy and a desire to better understand how technology affects the<br> 
                  delivery of city services, citizen engagement and understand how governments can operate more efficiently<br>
                  and transparently.<br>
                  <br>
                  Commitment: 12 hours a week minimum, with a 3-month commitment. Code for America’s offices are located in<br> 
                  downtown San Francisco, two blocks from Civic Center BART.<br>
