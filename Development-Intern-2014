                  The mission of Code for America is to help governments work better for everyone with the people <br> 
                  and the power of the web. Through our Fellowship, Accelerator, Brigade, and Peer Network we are<br> 
                  building a network of cities, citizens, community groups, and startups, all equally committed to<br>

                  <b>Code for America is looking for a Development Intern</b><br>
                  <br>
                  Over the past four years, Code for America has grown from a small team with a big idea to an<br> 
                  international network of thousands. As we expand, we’re committed to diversifying our revenue <br> 
                  streams and finding new sources of funding. That's why Code for America is looking for a<br> 
                  Development Intern.<br>
                  <br>
                  As a Development Intern you will have the opportunity to work for a nonprofit tech startup at the<br> 
                  forefront of civic innovation with reach across the world, and capitalize on that influence while<br> 
                  honing your analytical, research and communication skills. You will learn the strategies and tactics <br> 
                  of a successful fundraising program that includes institutional, corporate and individual donors and <br> 
                  understand the way in which the fundraising team collaborates with internal program and technology<br> 
                  teams and external partners. This is a great chance to develop real-world skills while growing your<br> 
                  network with innovative individuals and organizations across the country.<br>
                  <br>

                  which will include learning about the existing program, researching other programs to glean new <br> 
                  ideas and understand industry best practices and make recommendations to Senior Staff about the<br> 
                  best path to move forward on grassroots fundraising. Successful candidates will have an interest<br>
                  in the intersection of tech and public policy and a desire to better understand how technology<br> 
                  affects the delivery of city services, citizen engagement and understand how governments can<br> 
                  operate more efficiently and transparently.<br>
