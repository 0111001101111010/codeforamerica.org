<p>Through Code for America’s fellowship program, we recruit talented web developers, designers, and entrepreneurs into a year of <a href="#">public service</a> and then invite forward-thinking cities to apply to work with them, hand-in-hand, to help them better leverage technology and engage the community. Through this process — and the apps they create, datasets they open, and events they host — both the fellows and the cities not only make a real difference in each city, but they also show what’s possible in any city.</p>

<p>While technological and market advances over the past few decades have enabled the private sector to run more efficiently, government has been left behind, saddled with <a href="#">outdated and inefficient software and vendors</a>. That has to change. The Code for America Accelerator recruits “civic startups” and turbo-charges them with a national platform to raise awareness, a wealth of business training and advice, and a broad network of potential investors and civic leaders.</p>
