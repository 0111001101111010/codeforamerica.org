There is a wide variety of ways you can help Code for America.  Right now we are just getting started, so we need people to help spread the word and build the organization.  Here are some things you can do to help:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://codeforamerica.org/donate"><strong>Make a contribution of any size.</strong></a> We're small and scrappy with a big mission, so we have to work smart. Though we<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pahlkadot/4755465781/" target="blank">run lean</a>, we still have bills to pay, and we need your help.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="http://codeforamerica.org/for-cities/">Contact your city</a></strong> through the mayor's office, city council representative, city manager, or anyone else in local government where you live and ask them to consider applying for Code for America.  You can point them to our Call for Applications online.</li>
	<li><a href="http://codeforamerica.org/spread-the-word/"><strong>Spread the word</strong></a> to talented web developers, designers and product managers and encourage them to apply.  On an individual level, reach out to anyone you think would be a good fit and send them to this website.  On a broader scale, blog, tweet, or speak about Code for America in any forum that attracts web talent. We've put together some <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/spread-the-word/">outreach materials</a> to get you started.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="mailto:info@codeforamerica.org">Make a connection</a></strong>. If you're a web professional working for a medium to large company, talk to your employer about sponsoring one or more employees to participate. We'd love to see companies agree to hold jobs for employees who are chosen to serve in CFA for a year, or even supplement their stipends to maintain their incomes for the year.  We can provide significant exposure for companies who extend these benefits to their employees.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/cfa-labs?lnk=srg">Contribute some code</a></strong>. If you're a web professional who can help on a part-time but significant basis this year, we may need your help with some pilot projects. Join our <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/cfa-labs?lnk=srg">Code for America Labs Group</a> to join the conversation and track opportunities to help out.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="mailto:info@codeforamerica.org">Blog for us</a></strong>. If you can write and are interested in how cities are innovating, perhaps you can contribute to our blog.  Drop us a line with your pitch and some pointers to articles or posts you've written.</li>
</ul>
Whatever your interest in helping, don't hesitate to <a href="mailto:info@codeforamerica.org">get in touch</a>.
