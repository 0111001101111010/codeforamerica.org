This is a really interesting and cool article about the Open Trip Planner... 

The Open Trip Planner is an international effort, led by TriMet, to develop an open-source multi-modal online trip planning tool, unveiled as a new TriMet trip planner in October 2011.

In other words, the new planner can tell you whether you could save time by hopping on the MAX for part of your crosstown bike trip.
