<strong>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE <a href='http://codeforamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/CfAPressRelease-CityOutreach2012FINAL1.pdf'>(pdf)</a>:
</strong>San Francisco, CA ‚Äì December 9, 2010 ‚Äì Code for America is now accepting <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/cities/interested-city">applications from cities to participate in the 2012 City Program</a>. Code for America is seeking forward-thinking local governments who want to connect with the talent from the web industry to solve local problems through a service-year fellowship program. Citizens can <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/city-action">get involved by advocating</a> for their city's participation as well.

‚ÄúThere's an opportunity for cities to use this budget crisis to adapt to a more nimble, innovative approach to solving problems and providing services,‚Äù said Alissa Black, Code for America's City Program Director. Code for America recruits web developers, designers, and entrepreneurs to give a year of service, helping local governments become more efficient and open. For 2012, three to five cities will be selected through a competitive process, and applicants must demonstrate that their project has real cost-savings for the city and promotes transparency and public participation. Code for America is also encouraging government partners to take on one of several <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/model-city-projects/">Model City Projects</a>, based around common problems identified in municipalities nationwide. City representatives can begin the application process online; the deadline for application is March 1, 2011: <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/cities/interested-city/">http://codeforamerica.org/cities/interested-city/</a>

Code for America has also launched <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/city-action">tools for citizens to advocate</a> to bring the program to their city. The <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/city-action">Citizen Action Center</a> provides individuals with resources to build interest in their city both on- and offline. ‚ÄúAnyone can help bring Code for America to their city,‚Äù said Abhi Nemani, Director of Strategy and Communications. ‚ÄúThousands of people have asked us for ways to support the Code for America movement, and this is a great and simple way to make a difference.‚Äù The Citizen Action Center includes email templates, social media tools, a real-time map of support, and reference materials to help citizens engage their local officials and spread the word: <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/city-action">http://codeforamerica.org/city-action</a>

The 2012 program will be Code for America's second fellowship cycle. In 2011, four cities will be participating: Boston, MA, Philadelphia, PA, Seattle, WA, and Washington, DC. The Boston team will be building a platform for educational services to encourage innovative uses of open data to improve high school education, and DC will be developing mechanisms for governments across the country to share open-source software. The teams for Seattle and Philadelphia will be pursuing a project in collaboration: a civic leader initiative to build stronger communities and support neighborhood services. Said Mayor Michael A. Nutter of Philadelphia, ‚ÄúPhiladelphia looks forward to working with Code for America and these bold, innovative cities over the next year and a half to develop a web platform that takes technological transparency and civic engagement to new heights.‚Äù

Applications for the 2012 City Program are available online now and will be accepted until March 1, 2011:<a href="http://codeforamerica.org/cities/interested-city/"> http://codeforamerica.org/cities/interested-city/</a>
