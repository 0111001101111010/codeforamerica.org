<h3>The Fellowship Program</h3>
The Fellowship is an 11-month program where cities collaborate with a team of talented researchers, designers and developers to build <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/apps">apps</a>, inspire citizen engagement and increase capacity for city staff. Past apps have addressed economic development, healthcare, criminal justice, citizen engagement, transportation and more. Check out the fellowship experience:

<h3>Apps and Outcomes</h3>
<a href="/apps">Apps</a> are just the beginning. Fellows have helped cities release <a href="http://brigade.codeforamerica.org/pages/opendata">1000+ open data sets</a>, encouraged the creation of <a href="http://brigade.codeforamerica.org/">local brigades</a> and found new ways to engage citizens and staff. Said 2011 fellow Jeremy Canfield, "It marked me indelibly. I don't think I'll ever love a job as much as this one."

<h3>Selection and Application</h3>
Applications open in the Spring and close on July 31. We are building small project teams, so we're looking for people from a variety of disciplines. We need researchers to determine the city's needs, project managers to translate those needs into features, designers to fashion those features into a usable application, developers and programmers to build and code the applications and business analysts to integrate that application into a sustainable system.
