Wildfires, hurricanes, tornadoes and natural disasters are a regular and real part of life. It’s not only important to know which forces of nature you’re susceptible to, but to be prepared and ready for them. Built with help from the City of Austin and Texas Forest Service and easily redeployed for any type of disaster, Prepared.ly helps citizens prepare for the worst. The application provides near real-time information on home and business property risk, offers disaster preparedness tasks, offers the ability to track progress and set reminders, and connects directly to fire safety professionals.
