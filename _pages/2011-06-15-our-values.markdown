Several core values motivate what we do at Code for America. We strive to embody these values in our work and help them flourish in the world.

<strong>Public Service.</strong> People getting together to help improve our communities, our nation and our world is what will make a better future ... and it's what we're all about.

<strong>Community.</strong> We believe in making connections, sharing ideas and working together to make the places we live ones that support the efforts, aspirations and well-being of each member of the community.

<strong>Diversity.</strong> Our work is more effective and rewarding when individuals with different perspectives, experiences and backgrounds contribute to our efforts and guide our actions.

<strong>Sustainability.</strong> In order for our activities to have a truly long-term benefit, they must not undermine the health of the ecological systems that provide the basic requirements of life â€“ clean water, air and food.

<strong>Innovation.</strong> We are driven by a constant desire to improve and explore new ways to solve problems; this is the only way we'll meet the challenges we face and the changing terrain that we operate on.
