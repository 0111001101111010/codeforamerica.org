<h4>The Brigade</h4>
Lexington is known everywhere for its rich 238-year history and as the home of the best horses, best Bourbon and best college basketball (yes, that’s 8 NCAA championships). Take a closer look and you’ll find a dynamic mid-sized city with an exceptional quality of life. Home to one of the region’s leading research institutions, the University of Kentucky, as well as one of the nation’s oldest liberal arts colleges and a progressive community and technical college, Lexington is not just some college town…it’s a university city, where knowledge and creativity merge to create the perfect environment for innovation.

Named the fourth best city for "Businesses and Careers" in 2011 by Forbes Magazine, the city plays host to several large tech corporations including Xerox, Lexmark International and IBM, as well as numerous tech start-ups. Lexington’s ever-growing Code for America Brigade has more than 20 members and captains Chase Southard and Nick Such ensure that the group meets regularly for hackathons and discussions.
