<strong>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:</strong>

<strong>City of Chicago Chosen as Code for America City Finalist; Fellows Needed</strong>

<em>San Francisco, CA-- Wednesday, July 6, 2011 </em>-- Code for America is pleased to announce the City of Chicago is a finalist in its national fellowship program. Chicago’s selection demonstrates cutting-edge thinking and a willingness to invest in long-term change through the development of new web-based technology. <em></em>

Code for America, a non-profit loosely based on Teach for America, recruits the top talent from the technology industry to give a year of service to build innovative web applications for city governments. Through a competitive process, Code for America chooses cities whose proposals reflected a deep understanding of the power that technology can bring to cities. The 2012 Fellows will build on the success of Code for America’s inaugural projects in Boston, Philadelphia, and Seattle. For the 2012 program, over 20 governments applied, and 10 finalists move on to the final round for consideration. Code for America will announce the winning cities later this summer.

Since taking office in May 2011, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel has made significant reforms and investments in information technology and data transparency. Emanuel’s Chief Technology Officer John Tolva and his team have been tasked with leveraging technology to ensure that the City delivers better services at a lower cost to taxpayers.

“We are honored that Chicago is a finalist in the Code for America’s fellowship competition, and very hopeful that come 2012, we will all be working together improving the way Chicago provides its citizens with the services they need while decreasing inefficiencies and engaging people in new and innovative ways,” said Tolva.

The City of Chicago’s application applied for the partnership with Code for America to help it implement innovative solutions, like “Open311,” that will ensure the City is more efficient, open and responsive. Across the country, governments have been adopting a common standard for 311 reporting known as “Open311,” which means that applications built on 311 data <em>anywhere</em> can be used <em>everywhere</em>. The City of Chicago has requested that the Code for America fellows deploy this “Open311” standard in Chicago, which would open up access to dozens of web and mobile applications that would essentially revolutionize the way Chicagoans make service requests to the city. Through “Open311,” Chicagoans would be able to easily track the status of their requests, and city officials will be allowed to monitor these requests more efficiently and respond more quickly.

“One promising aspect of the program is to join the best thinking from the web industry with the best thinking from cities,” said Jennifer Pahlka, founder and executive director of Code for America. As part of the program, Code for America will be conducting brainstorming sessions with each city, when web industry innovators and thought leaders are invited to meet with key stakeholders inside city government to further develop and solidify the conceptual projects they’ve proposed. Once the partnership and problem are clearly defined, three tech-savvy individuals (fellows) recruited by Code for America will begin to develop a light-weight creative solution that solves the problem. The solution built for Chicago will be available to other cities facing similar challenges.
