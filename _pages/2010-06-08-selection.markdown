If you have a talent for using technology to really engage people, the Code for America fellowship may be the best way for you to make a real difference. It will push your limits, give you new skills and perspective, and it will be hugely rewarding. It's about using your skills to give back. We're a "Peace Corps for geeks" and to borrow their tagline: it will be the toughest job you'll ever love.
<h2>Who are we looking for?</h2>
The average fellow is 30-years-old with some previous work experience and an interest in helping communities. Fellows from across the country come together from a variety of development, design, research and project management backgrounds. Code for America is committed to a diverse fellowship class. Minorities and women are encouraged to apply. Interested? Fill out <a href="https://codeforamerica.wufoo.com/forms/z7p0x3">this form</a> and we'll let you know when applications open.
<h2>How do I apply?</h2>
The application process begins in the Spring. Fill out <a href="https://codeforamerica.wufoo.com/forms/z7p0x3">this form</a> to be notified when the process opens. When applications open, we'll ask for info on your past experiences, links to your work and more info on your interest.
<h2>When will I know if I've made it?</h2>
Candidates advancing in the process will be asked for interviews and references. Here's the application timeline:
<ul>
	<li>End of July: Application Deadline</li>
	<li>September: Selection Notification</li>
	<li>October: Public Announcement of Fellows</li>
	<li>January: Program Start</li>
</ul>
<h2>Where would I be working?</h2>
You'll spend the majority of your time in <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/IqhhH">Code for America HQ in downtown San Francisco</a> where you'll share resources across teams, train with mentors and learn from industry speakers. In the month of February, you'll be embedded on-site in your assigned city, working with city officials and meeting with community members to achieve a deep understanding of community needs. These are learnings necessary for project development and in some cases fellows return to their cities again to collaborate with community stakeholders and city staff. (<em>*Note: You will be asked for your top city partner choices once you're selected for the fellowship, but city partners are not announced until after the July 31 fellowship application deadline</em>)
<h2>Can non-US residents apply?</h2>
Code for America cannot sponsor work visas for international applicants. Non-US citizens with the necessary paperwork to participate in the year-long fellowship are welcome to apply.If you're interested in civic hacking in your country check out our <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/international">International Partnership Program</a>.
