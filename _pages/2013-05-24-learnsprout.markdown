LearnSprout brings interoperability and accessibility to school data. We build tools to access the valuable data (e.g. roster info, grades, attendance) currently silo-ed away in legacy student information systems used across US K12. Weâ€™re creating a web API service that allows developers to build classroom apps that leverage this data, without the expensive enterprise-like vendor integration process. Lack of easy access to school data stifles innovation in the education space and creates unnecessary cost, time, and risk for both schools and app makers. We want to change this.
