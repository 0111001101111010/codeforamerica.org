<img src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Chris-Barna.jpg" border="0" align="left" width="80" /><p><strong>Chris Barna</strong> is studying political science and math at Santa Clara University. He is passionate about open government and open data, and has experience building useful applications both inside and outside government. In Fall 2010, he interned with the FCC's new media team helping with the FCC.gov redesign project, which has been widely regarded as the standard bearer for modern government websites. But when he's not programming in Javascript, PHP, Ruby, or Python, you can probably find him playing alto saxophone or reading. This summer, he'll join the team working on the Open311 Dashboard.
