In the midst of winter snowstorms, buried hydrants cause dangerous delays for fire fighters. But having City of Boston employees check and clear thousands of hydrants would be a timely, costly and burdensome process.

Adopt-a-Hydrant lets governments look to community members for help. This map-based web app allows individuals, small businesses and community organizations to volunteer in shoveling out specific hydrants.
