Honolulu Answers is a first-of-its-kind for municipal government. It’s a citizen-centric website that is question driven with clean, easy-to-navigate design. This simple site functions similar to Google — it centers around a search box where a resident can ask a question or type in keywords using standard language and receive friendly and comprehensible responses.
