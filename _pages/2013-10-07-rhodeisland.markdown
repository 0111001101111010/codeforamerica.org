<h4>The Community</h4>
Nicknamed the “Ocean State”, Rhode Island is known for its large bays and inlets as well as its rich New England history. Rhode Island was the first of the original US colonies to declare Independence from British rule and the last of the colonies to ratify the US Constitution ensuring that the Bill of Rights was one of its amendments. The oldest Fourth of July Parade is still held annually in Bristol Rhode Island. 

At present, the State is home to a number of renowned advanced education institutions including Brown University, Providence College and Rhode Island School of Design. As the State enters into its 2014 Code for America fellowship year, it will continue to find ways to engage citizens and increase performance using new technologies.
