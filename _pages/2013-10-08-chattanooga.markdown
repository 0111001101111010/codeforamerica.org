<h4>The Community</h4>
Known as the "Scenic City", Chattanooga is surrounded on by mountains and ridges. Although famous for its natural beauty, Chattanooga also boasts some of the fastest Internet speeds in the country and the city is home to large tech companies like Amazon and local newcomers Supply Hog, Sodaworks and Variable Technologies.

Starting next year, a team of developers will begin to build Web apps intended to improve city services and community outreach in Chattanooga.
Mayor Andy Berke's office announced this morning that Chattanooga is one of 10 cities chosen for a Code for America fellowship. Code for America is a California-based nonprofit organization that pairs Web developers with cities across the U.S. to develop tech solutions that "improve the relationships between citizens and government," according to the organization's website.
