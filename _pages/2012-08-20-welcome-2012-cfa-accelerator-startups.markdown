We collect information on federal, state, county, city, neighborhood and nonprofit programs and put it all in one place. In just a few seconds, users can enter basic information and find programs relevant to their needs. Currently, Aunt Bertha has rolled out this search service to the State of Texas (roughly 1/12 of the American population) and is preparing to scale nationwide. More than 17,000 people have used AuntBertha.com.</p>

<blockquote>“As a parole officer working with ex-offenders, it can be exceptionally difficult to find resources. Aunt Bertha has been a great tool that allows people to find help for themselves and often, support their family’s needs as well!”

<em>-- Erin McGann, Texas Department of Criminal Justice</em>

“I have been involved in both the philanthropic and delivery side of social services for over 30 years. Nothing has come close to Aunt Bertha's solution-based ideas and implementation.”

<em>-- Sara Speer Selber, Former CEO of AIDS Foundation Houston</em></blockquote>

<h3>Aunt Bertha on the Accelerator:</h3>
Since joining the Code for America Accelerator, the number of weekly visitors has jumped 62 percent and people are spending 49 percent more time on the platform on average, per visit.
<blockquote>"We’re launched in Texas, which is 1/12 of the American population. Code for America helped make the connections we will need to expand our service to the rest of the country and we’re on track to do it in 2013.”

<em>-- Erine Gray, Founder and CEO of Aunt Bertha</em></blockquote>

We can get data off of paper and into a digital spreadsheet quickly and cheaply, taking care of the data entry so you don’t have to! We’re not an optical character recognition (OCR) service. We provide human-quality data entry that works on hand-writing -- but at a fraction of what manual data entry costs.

<blockquote>“There is a gold mine of this important information which is virtually impossible to really use because it’s on paper, or at best, scans of paper forms. Captricity unlocks that data and allows us to offer it to the public in a digital, machine-readable format.  It allows us to further our mission and keep the public genuinely more informed.”

<em>-- Ann Ravel, Commission Chair of the Fair Political Practices Commission of California</em></blockquote>
&nbsp;
<h3>Captricity on the Accelerator:</h3>
Over the course of the Accelerator, Captricity began working with the FPPC, received funding from the <a href="http://www.knightfoundation.org/" target="_blank">Knight Foundation</a>, and launched an iOS mobile app, a suite of cloud integrations including Salesforce, Box, Dropbox, and Constant Contact, an open data portal, and a self-signup pay-as-you-go API.

The Accelerator enabled numerous civic contacts and ongoing discussions in the government space.
<blockquote>“From Captricity’s early days, we thought that the technology’s ability to capture and digitize data from paper forms would be extremely useful in governments. However, we knew very little about how governments worked and had no contacts in the civic space. Code for America has given us the knowledge, understanding, and contacts we need to better support the work of civic leaders across the country.”

<em>-- Kuang Chen, CEO of Captricity</em></blockquote>

<img id="rg_hi" class="aligncenter" src="http://codeforamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Logo-Horizontal.png" alt="" height="70" />LearnSprout brings interoperability and accessibility to school data. We build tools to access the valuable data (e.g. roster info, grades, attendance) currently silo-ed away in legacy student information systems used across US K12. We’re creating a web API service that allows developers to build classroom apps that leverage this data, without the expensive enterprise-like vendor integration process. Lack of easy access to school data stifles innovation in the education space and creates unnecessary cost, time, and risk for both schools and app makers. We want to change this.

<p dir="ltr">"LearnSprout took just a few minutes to set up and eliminated the hassle of integrating with our PowerSchool student information system. It's been refreshingly simple and reliable."</p>

<h3>LearnSprout on the Accelerator:</h3>
<blockquote>"I've been amazed by how quickly things have taken off since joining Code for America. An API can be difficult to explain because it's invisible and unknown to those who benefit the most, but our mentors at Code for America have shared some ingenious ideas that have had a dramatic and immediate impact. Needless to say, we are reluctant graduates. We'd do it again if we could."

<h3>Measured Voice on the Accelerator:</h3>
<blockquote>"The Code for America Accelerator has been invaluable. It’s introduced us to experienced mentors who have helped us create a world-class product. We’ve also been able to get feedback on our product from dozens of people working in government throughout the country."

<img class="aligncenter" src="http://codeforamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Recovers-Logo.png" alt="" height="75" />We’re building a toolkit for community powered disaster recovery. Our disaster response platform at [townname].recovers.org incorporates searchable databases, social media aggregation, and mobile tools, allowing grassroots organizers to efficiently marshal resources in their area. We can launch a site for an affected area in minutes, or set up an area with preparedness software and training. This allows an area to turn the wave of interest into a database of usable resources, even if their internet is knocked out for a week.

<strong>Get to know Recovers  //</strong>  <a title="Recovers" href="http://www.recovers.org">http://recovers.org</a>  //  founders[@]recovers.org
<blockquote>"We did not already have <a href="http://recovers.org/">Recovers</a> in place before the disaster, and while the learning curve on their system is very simple, it would have been immensely beneficial if we had put their program in place before a disaster. If there's ever another disaster in your area, the very first person I would call would be Caitria and the <a href="http://recovers.org/">recovers</a> team and one of the first things I would focus on would be implementing their site and systems into the community recovery effort from the very beginning."

&nbsp;
<h3>Recovers on the Accelerator:</h3>
<blockquote>"A disaster touches everyone in the community, and believe that everyone should be able to participate in the recovery effort. But to be able to do so safely, efficiently, and effectively, they need tools and marching orders. We've built our platform specifically for people who aren't prepared to manage resources. Code for America has helped us refine these tools, and deliver them to preparing communities. In just a few months, they've taken us from goodhearted idea, to technology company."

<img class="aligncenter" src="http://codeforamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Revelstone.png" alt="" width="270" />Revelstone is a performance metrics and social networking company for the public sector. We are building an online virtual community that enables local government leaders to measure, compare, and discuss operational performance results with their peers in order to learn from each other to improve. Our product, Compass, is the first and only SAAS-based platform that leverages both performance management and social media technologies to achieve this goal.

<strong>Get to know Revelstone //</strong> <a title="Revelstone Labs" href="http://www.revelstonelabs.com">http://revelstonelabs.com</a> // founders[@]revelstonelabs.com
<blockquote>“We are convinced the Revelstone strategy of organizing, storing, and sharing data with so many communities will be extremely valuable to mayors across the country.  The platform’s benchmarking capabilities are advantageous to elected officials because it allows them to provide residents with a clear explanation about why a certain change makes sense both financially and in terms of benefits to the entire community.  Any time an elected official can relate empirical statistical data to residents it provides a factual and historical rationale for why any type of change or project makes sense, and that the decision was not indiscriminately reached on a whim.”

<em>-- Dave Fried, Mayor of the Robbinsville, New Jersey Township</em></blockquote>
<h3>Revelstone on the Accelerator:</h3>
<blockquote> “Code for America is inspiring a government innovation movement and as part of that is working with Revelstone to ensure citizens are living in efficient and well-run cities and towns.  The CfA Accelerator has helped to turbo-charge our business with advice, national awareness, introductions to the technology elite of Silicon Valley and nurturing potential investment opportunities.”
