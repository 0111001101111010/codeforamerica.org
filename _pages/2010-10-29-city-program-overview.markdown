<td><em>Recruitment:</em> Cities participate in a competitive application process. In their application and subsequent interviews they must prove that they have the leadership to overcome bureaucratic obstacles, have secured funding to support the project, and have identified a project that has real cost-savings for the city, and promotes transparency and public participation.</td>
</tr>
<tr style="text-align: left;">
<td><strong>May '11 - July '11</strong></td>
<td><em>Contracting</em>: Cities enter a one-year contract with Code for America. The contract must be completed prior to our team beginning the program with your city. Upon completion of your application you will receive a sample contract for review and vetting by your legal departments.</td>

<td><strong>Aug '11 - Dec '11</strong></td>
<td><em>Tech Leaders Brainstorm with the City</em>: The promise of Code for America is to bring the best thinking of government together with the best thinking from industry. Tech leaders apply their thought-leadership and industry expertise to the process of conceptualizing the projects, helping us think about them critically, making sure they fit our criteria, and otherwise generally help us understand how they can be successful. We also look to them for input on design approaches, best practices, and ways the industry solves some of the same problems our governments are facing.</td>

<td><strong>January '12</strong></td>
<td><em>Orientation/CfA Training</em>: The selected CfA fellows come together at the headquarters for a month of training, team building, working on internal tools, and project research. We bring in prominent guest speakers to provide inspiration and to build the corps' network. The fellows are divided to teams of about five, each team assigned to a host city and that city's project.</td>
</tr>
<tr style="text-align: left; background-color: #f2f2f2;">
<td><strong>February '12</strong></td>
<td><em>City Tour</em>: Next, fellows split into groups and visit their host cities for one month. Their job is to learn how city government works, build a network of contacts in City Hall, and understand more about the issue we are partnering with the city to solve. The city sponsor serves as host, orienting the fellows, setting up meetings for them with a broad array of stakeholders and answering questions. The goal is to be able to represent the needs of their host city when they return for the development phase.</td>
</tr>
<tr style="text-align: left;">
<td><strong>March '12 - Aug '12</strong></td>
<td><em>Development</em>: Each team then has seven months to develop their application for their city. Teams work together at headquarters, sharing resources where appropriate. They are all driving towards the same launch date. Ongoing training and guest speaker series continue through this phase.</td>
</tr>
<tr style="text-align: left; background-color: #f2f2f2;">
<td><strong>September '12</strong></td>
<td><em>Beta Launch and Launch Conference</em>: At month nine of the cycle, teams launch their applications. Staff from all the host cities come to headquarters for a launch conference, where each of the projects is demoed. This is an opportunity for the cities to strengthen their relationships with each other and discuss common priorities, including common technology needs and open data standards.</td>
</tr>
<tr style="text-align: left;">
<td><strong>Oct '12 - Nov '12</strong></td>
<td><em>Maintenance and hand-off</em>: In the final months, the fellows document their work, fix bugs and add final features, and work with the city to transition maintenance of the application to their own IT department (or other option).</td>
