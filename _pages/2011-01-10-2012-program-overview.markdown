Code for America is now accepting applications from local governments to partner with our staff, fellows, and our network of tech leaders for our 2012 Program. The Interest Form is the first step in becoming a 2012 Code for America city.
<h2><span style="color: #444444;">What is Code for America?</span></h2>
Code for America is a non-profit organization that connects the brightest minds from the web industry with passionate public leaders to address the core problems facing our cities. We are currently seeking local government partners ready to work toward solving local problems while rebuilding our civic infrastructure to be more efficient, transparent, and participatory.
<h2><span style="color: #444444;">Benefits of Participation</span></h2>
<ul>
	<li>Code for America fellows dedicated to solving your city's problem
<ul>
	<li>CfA's fellowship program is one of the most competitive in the country. Last year our acceptance rate for fellows into our program was less than 6%.</li>
	<li>We recruit leading web and tech professionals, and recent graduates from top-notch schools who have a passion for public service. They are skilled designers, programmers, researchers, and project and product managers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Providing a new kind of solution
<ul>
	<li>Web 2.0 has changed the way people create and consume information, connect with one another and operate across platforms. We will use these game changing principles when creating a new kind of solution for your city.</li>
	<li>This is a time for a new way of thinking and a new approach to solving age old problems. There's a reason ‚Äúage old‚Äù problems plague our cities, because traditional approaches fail to solve them. Our talented group of fellows will apply new ways of thinking and create a sustainable solution for your city.</li>

<h2><span style="color: #444444;">The Program</span></h2>
Recruitment: Cities participate in a competitive application process. In their application and subsequent interviews they must prove that they have the leadership to overcome bureaucratic obstacles, have secured funding to support the project, and have identified a project that has real cost-savings for the city while also promoting transparency and public participation.

Contracting: Cities enter a one-year contract with Code for America. The contract must be completed prior to our team beginning the program with your city. Upon completion of your application you will receive a sample contract for review and vetting by your legal department.

Orientation/CfA Training: The selected CfA fellows come together at headquarters for a month of training, team building, working on internal tools, and project research. We bring in prominent guest speakers to provide inspiration and to build the corps' network. The fellows are divided into teams of approximately five; each team assigned to a host city and that city's project.

City Tour: Next, fellows split into groups and visit their host cities for one month. Their job is to learn how city government works, build a network of contacts in City Hall, and understand more about the issue we are partnering with the city to solve. The city sponsor serves as host, orienting the fellows, setting up meetings for them with a broad array of stakeholders and answering questions. The goal is to be able to represent the needs of their host city when they return for the development phase.

Tech Leaders Brainstorm with the City: The promise of Code for America is to bring the best thinking of government together with the best thinking from industry. Tech leaders apply their thought-leadership and industry expertise to the process of conceptualizing the projects, helping us think about them critically, making sure they fit our criteria, and otherwise generally help us understand how they can be successful. We also look to them for input on design approaches, best practices, and ways the industry solves some of the same problems our governments are facing.

Development: Each team then has seven months to develop a solution for their city. Teams work together at headquarters, sharing resources where appropriate. They are all driving toward the same launch date. Ongoing training and guest speaker series continue through this phase.

Launch and Launch Conference: At month nine of the cycle, teams launch their solutions. Staff from all the host cities come to headquarters for a launch conference, where each of the projects is demoed. This is an opportunity for the cities to strengthen their relationships with each other and discuss common priorities, including common technology needs and open data standards.

Maintenance and hand-off: In the final months, the fellows document their work and work with the city to transition any maintenance of tech solutions to their own IT department (or other option).
<h2><span style="color: #444444;">Requirements of Participation</span></h2>
Cities will be required to fulfill all the requirements below in order to participate in the 2012 Program.
<ul>
	<li>Sign a Letter of Intent upon notification of selection into the 2012 Program.</li>
</ul>
The City sponsor will sign the Letter of Intent which states that they agree to the payment schedule and are committed to working with CfA for the full term of the 2012 Program.
<ul>
	<li>Pay a program fee of $250,000 for the year. The fee covers a portion of the stipends for our fellows. Code for America will work with you on identifying additional outside funding sources for us to partner with to fund our administrative and other program fees.</li>
	<li>Identify a project that meets the goals for the CfA program. Projects should leverage the web as a platform, increase transparency, participation and efficiency, and be achievable by a team of five developers and designers in approximately nine months. Each project proposal will include a business analysis, showing the internal ROI to the city.</li>
	<li>Participate in the City Brainstorm meeting during February, 2012 (the City Tour month). CfA will arrange to bring in contacts from our network to help think through and further develop the opportunities inherent in the project proposed. Active participation in this meeting by the key stakeholders in City Hall is necessary.</li>
	<li>Work closely on managing and expediting contracting and other project documents. The City sponsor will work with the contracting department to review the CfA template Statement of Work and Contract. All contracting language will be finalized within 60 days of signing the Letter of Intent (LOI).</li>
	<li>Support the program. The City sponsor will be responsible for working with our City Program Director on the curriculum during City Tour month, will develop a communication plan to facilitate ongoing communication with the necessary departments within the city, and agrees to participate (along with other appropriate staff) at the Launch Conference in September 2012.</li>
	<li>Be prepared to support the project. The city must be committed to the success of the project, including support from the relevant internal departments, adequate resourcing of technology needs to implement the project, and a well-developed plan for transition from any legacy systems.</li>
	<li>Demonstrate internal alignment around the CfA effort. An outside team developing a new kind of solution faces many obstacles within the bureaucracy of city government. Applicant cities are encouraged to have honest internal discussions about the willingness of all the stakeholders to support the project and be frank about the chances for success.</li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="color: #444444;">How to Apply</span></h2>
An online application is available at <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/cities">codeforamerica.org/cities</a>. In the application, cities are asked to state their interest, describe the technology environment, strategic direction of the city, and describe up to three possible problems or projects they would like the CfA team to solve during the 2012 Program.
<h2><span style="color: #444444;">What We Are Looking For</span></h2>
We are looking for applicant cities that demonstrate strong leadership that can maneuver through or overcome bureaucratic obstacles, funding to support the project, and have identified a project that has real cost-savings for the city, and promotes transparency and public participation. Additionally, we are interested in building solutions that can widely be reused by other local governments.

Applications will be reviewed by a team of technology and government leaders. The cities who appear most likely to succeed with a CfA team will be asked to partake in various interviews and information gathering discussions.
