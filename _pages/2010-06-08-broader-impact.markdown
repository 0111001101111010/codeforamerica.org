Code for America isn't just a way to offer city governments technical talent at less than market rates. Beyond just the projects our fellows build, the program is designed to:

<strong>Cultivate the next generation of public sector technology leaders.
</strong>Up to 60% of the municipal workforce in many cities will retire in the next five years. This represents not only a crisis of talent, but also a huge opportunity. Think how much can change if we fill those positions with people who have a native understanding of how technology can work in modern urban life.

<strong>Inject a culture virus into city government. 
</strong>We recruit fellows who demonstrate a networked, web-centric and open approach to problem-solving. Attaching the fellows to the city for the year and helping them build relationships with a wide variety of city workers is an effective way to introduce this kind of thinking and help it spread

<strong>Encourage experimentation. 
</strong>The fellows will be available for side projects in the city that would be difficult to move forward through standard channels. The city leadership and the fellows can function as an ad hoc innovation team, collaborating on a series of interesting experiments throughout the year, all of which will be shared with the other cities.

<strong>Change the tool set. 
</strong>Part of the job of the fellows will be to help introduce lightweight, simple technology that can help with internal functions. These small changes can have large lasting effects. 

<strong>Facilitate collaboration with other cities. 
</strong>Code for America is building a network of city leaders who believe there is a better way of doing things, and the program involves both formal and informal channels to share ideas and lessons learned. We're also working more robust channels for sharing applications and setting technology standards across cities.
