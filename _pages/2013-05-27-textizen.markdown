"What if you didn’t have to trek to a town hall or city council meeting to be heard? What if City Hall could open its ears to nearly the entire city?

Textizen asks questions on posters in public places, then collects citizen feedback via text message. Anyone with a minute and an opinion can reply.

Textizen’s cloud-based platform allows city officials and community groups to create surveys and track feedback as it comes in. Textizen not only allows a city to garner more representative feedback from a larger cross-section of their communities, but allows for data-driven decisions and more empowered residents."
