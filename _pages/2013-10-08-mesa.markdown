<h4>The 2014 Fellowship in Mesa</h4>
For its 2014 fellowship year, Mesa is excited to have the opportunity to partner with Arizona State University, the first partnership of its kind in the fellowship program.

<b>Arizona State University – Polytechnic Campus – College of Technology and Innovation (CTI)</b>

ASU’s Polytechnic campus is home to more than 6,000 students exploring ASU’s professional and technological programs. Thousands of square feet of laboratory space make way for project-based learning.

At ASU's College of Technology and Innovation (CTI) they make things. They make things that matter. They make positive change. They make leaders. But most of all, they make ideas happen.
