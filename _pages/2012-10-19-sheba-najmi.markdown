Sheba Najmi is a product strategist and user experience designer. At Yahoo! for nearly 7 years, she was a lead designer for Yahoo! Mail, the company’s flagship service with over 260 million users. After that, she product-managed the complete redesign of customer experience management applications at iSKY TRG. Most recently, Sheba co-founded a startup focused on the oft-overlooked baby boomer and senior citizen audiences. In a past life, Sheba has also worked as a television news anchor in Pakistan, interviewing and reporting on news and current affairs from both the streets and the studio. Sheba earned MS and BS degrees in Symbolic Systems from Stanford University, where she investigated the language, thought, and interaction of humans and computers.

As a fellow at Code for America, Sheba is the Project Lead for <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/?cfa_project=honolulu-answers" target="_blank">Honolulu Answers</a>, a new approach to make it easier for people to navigate city information and services quickly. It's a citizen-focused website that's driven by citizens' questions <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbS5NwGn1-0">(see glimpses of the first-ever civic write-a-thon)</a>. She's also the Project Lead on the <a href="http://thesocialcity.org" target="_blank">Social Media Handbook for Cities</a>.

Post-fellowship, Sheba's eager to be a part of a social enterprise that values openness, transparency, JFDI, and fun -- all while making a meaningful contribution towards bettering our world.
