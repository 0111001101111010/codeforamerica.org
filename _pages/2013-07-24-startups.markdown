<h3>The Opportunity for Civic Startups</h3>
Code for America believes that by supporting a competitive civic tech startup, we are supporting governments in their ability to get value for dollar and procure top tech services and products. Our programs help talented entrepreneurs create sustainable businesses and connect with govtech leaders.

<h3>The Accelerator</h3>
The Code for America Accelerator “turbo-charges” select civic startups by providing them an opportunity to amplify market awareness of their product, to access a wealth of business training and advice, and to be introduced to a broad network of potential investors and civic leaders. The program runs from July to November and those chosen receive $25K in no-strings funding, mentorship from celebrated civic tech veterans and access to the Code for America network.

<h3>Incubator</h3>
The CfA Incubator is a no-nonsense, highly focused experience helping teams build a sustainable business from their current product ideas. The program runs from December to June to support the sustainability of applications emerging from the fellowship, to develop apps into scalable business enterprises, and to retain these talented civic technologists where they are most needed: strengthening the ecosystem.
