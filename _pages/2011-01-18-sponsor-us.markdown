Code for America exists because people are excited about the potential of a new kind of public service â€” one that allows us to dramatically improve how we all work together in our common interest. By leveraging the tools we use every day to do the business of government, we can bring neighbors together to improve their communities, give students access to a city full of educational opportunities, and reduce the cost of delivering basic services.

This work is only possible because some amazing organizations have sponsored our efforts through a variety of in-kind contributions and fiscal support, including Cisco System, Google, Microsoft, and many others.  From giving us free office space to donating office equipment, support for our efforts has taken many forms and has been instrumental in our work to make government more open and efficient.

Please contact us if you would like to sponsor our work as well.  Abhi Nemani, Director of Communications and Strategy, would be glad to discuss an individual sponsorship package that matches your support with a key need of our organization.  He can be reached at 618-322-2220 or abhi@codeforamerica.org.
