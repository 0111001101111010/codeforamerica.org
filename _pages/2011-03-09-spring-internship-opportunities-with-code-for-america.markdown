<p>The CfA staff is small and new, and we've got a massive challenge ahead of us: working with 20 new fellows to make a real impact in cities across the country. To help us out, we're looking for developers, bloggers, researchers, and fundraisers. These roles may sound like typical internships you've seen or even had ‚Äî the kind where you're promised a meaningful impact, but end up getting coffee or worse, de-duping excel sheets. Trust us, this isn't your typical internship. You'll have autonomy, creative input, and responsibility. Lots of it. Plus, you'll get to work with a small, passionate, and experienced team that'll rely on you to do more than you were asked.

Find more information about the available roles below. We are accepting applications on a rolling basis. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to contact us at info@codeforamerica.org. <strong>Apply now</strong> using the form on the right.

Interns need to commit to at least 10 hours of work a week, and should be in the Bay Area so they can come by the office to say hello from time to time. For passionate non-local applicants, however, we're willing to make an exemption.

<strong>Developers
</strong>We need coders in all the major webby languages. Python, PHP, Ruby, .Net, Pearl and Java. You won't be cleaning up other people's sloppy html or tweaking our facebook page; rather, you'll be standing up instances of existing open source applications and customizing them to meet our growing needs. You'll work with our fellows, the CTO, and, well, me on projects like WordPress, AntHill, ThinkUp, Joget, Confluence, and a host of other interesting open source apps on cutting-edge cloud based services like Rackspace, Amazon, and others.

<strong>Bloggers & Researchers
</strong>As we build our apps, we'll be building our own web presence as well. Over the past year, CfA has been thrilled to be part of the active and meaningful conversation taking place about the impact of technology on governance. As an intern, it would be your responsibility to help make us a leader in that discussion. This would involve researching stories, gathering data, drafting posts, seeking out cool technologies for review and generating other forms of content as well, ranging from graphics to videos ‚Äî whatever would help us get our message of geeky public service out there.

<strong>Development & Outreach
</strong>Of course, none of that can happen unless we can pay the bills. As a non-profit, Code for America relies on the generous support of foundations, corporations, philanthropists, and anyone else willing to donate their money, time, or services. It's a daily, challenging, and rewarding task reaching out to new donors. Since we hope and expect to grow (a lot) in the coming years, we're going to need help tracking down leads, drafting grant applications, and reaching out to potential donors. It's not an easy job, but when you do it, you earn the satisfaction of knowing that every dollar you bring it keeps our beautiful little experiment alive a little longer.

By the way, if you think we're kidding about needing so much help that everyone does everything, see for yourself:

Yes, that's Tim O'Reilly -- Board Member and Founder of O'Reilly Media  -- nailing up the white board to the wall. Why don't you come on board and give him a hand. :)
