The Code for America process is partnership between our organization and the city. Participating cities  will be required to fulfill all the requirements below in order to participate in the 2012 Program.

<em>(Note: Currently we are currently only able to partner with U.S. cities.)</em>

<strong>Identify a project that meets the goals for the CfA program.</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Projects should leverage the web as a platform, increase transparency, participation and efficiency, and be achievable by a team of five developers and designers in approximately nine months. Each project proposal will include a business analysis, showing the internal ROI to the city.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Sign a Letter of Intent upon notification of selection.</strong>
<ul>
	<li>The City sponsor will sign the Letter of Intent which states that they agree to the payment schedule and are committed to working with CfA for the full term of the 2012 Program.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Pay a one-time participation fee of $250,000 for the year.</strong>
<ul>
	<li>The fee covers a portion of the stipends for our fellows. Code for America will work with you on identifying outside funding sources for us to partner with to fund our administrative and other program fees.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Participate in the City Brainstorm meetings in the early fall of the preceding year.</strong>
<ul>
	<li>CfA will arrange to bring in contacts from our network to help think through and further develop the opportunities inherent in the project proposed. Active participation in this meeting by the key stakeholders in City Hall is necessary.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Work closely on managing and expediting contracting and other project documents.</strong>
<ul>
	<li>The City sponsor will work with the contracting department to review the CfA template Statement of Work and Contract. All contracting language will be finalized within 60 days of signing the Letter of Intent (LOI).</li>
</ul>
<strong>Support the program and the fellows.</strong>
<ul>
	<li>The City sponsor will be responsible for working with our City Program Director on the curriculum during City Tour month, will develop a communication plan to facilitate ongoing communication with the necessary departments within the city, and agrees to participate (along with other appropriate staff) at the Launch Conference in September 2012.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Be prepared to support the project.</strong>
<ul>
	<li>The city must be committed to the success of the project, including support from the relevant internal departments, adequate resourcing of technology needs to implement the project, and a well-developed plan for transition from any legacy systems.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Demonstrate internal alignment around the CfA effort.</strong>
<ul>
	<li>An outside team developing a Web 2.0 project faces many obstacles within the bureaucracy of city government. Applicant cities are encouraged to have honest internal discussions about the willingness of all the stakeholders to support the project and be frank about the chances for success.</li>
</ul>
