-Mayor Robert Reichert</blockquote>
The City of Macon had already taken great strides towards openness -- including a more information rich website, live streams of city council meetings, and an updated work order system for service requests. To further their goals of openness and citizen engagement, Macon proposed to partner with Code for America to strengthen the avenues for connection between Macon's citizens and their government.

The project created a technology suite to connect citizens with their government so services could be better directed and result in high quality government services to the people in Macon. The process began with an intensive discovery process where the Code for America team accessed and built on existing communication assets. Residents that were interested in actively engaging in making their neighborhood or city better now have a tool to collaborate with and organize other interested residents.
<h3>Challenge</h3>
Macon has been selected as a partner for the 2012 Code for America Fellowship and CfA Fellows took on the challenge. In less than a year, they worked with the city and local partners to go from concept to delivery -- with everything from research and marketing to development and testing.
