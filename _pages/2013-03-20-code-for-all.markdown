<br> <strong>Code for All is a global movement for 21st century government.</strong> The international arm of Code for America, we connect a global network of technologists working with government to create innovative civic technology.

We are now building the international network infrastructure and engaging our pilot partners, who will be announced in May 2013.

<strong>Code for All and its partners will be governed by the following values:
</strong>
<strong>We code.</strong>  The goal is sustainable institutional change, but the innovation gap in government won’t shrink without the skills and approaches of today’s technologists.  Fellows teams function like a small start-up within government, quickly delivering tools that solve real problems, and leveraging and contributing to the civic tech ecosystem.

<strong>We show what’s possible.</strong> Using lean start-up methods and user-centered design thinking, Code for All fellows create interfaces to government that are simple, beautiful, and easy to use, and do this dramatically faster and cheaper than through traditional channels. Showing what’s possible changes the conversation, sets a new bar, and creates political will for innovation in government.

<strong>We improve government, not politics.</strong> Code for All’s work focuses on opening and innovating the bureaucracy of government: how government delivers services, communicates with citizens, and creates opportunity.  We leave the reform of politics to other organizations.

<strong>We operate in public.</strong> Everything we build is open source. We actively encourage documentation, sharing, and app reuse.

<strong>We help build an ecosystem.</strong> Whenever possible we reuse existing tools and platforms, encouraging integration and extension.
