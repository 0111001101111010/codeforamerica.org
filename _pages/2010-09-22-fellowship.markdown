<h3>The Fellowship</h3>
The Fellowship is an 11-month program where cities collaborate with a team of talented researchers, designers and developers to build <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/apps">apps</a>, inspire citizen engagement and increase capacity for city staff. Past apps have addressed economic development, healthcare, criminal justice, citizen engagement, transportation and more. Check out the fellowship experience:

<h3>Apps and Outcomes</h3>
<a href="/apps">Apps</a> are just the beginning. Cities have released <a href="http://brigade.codeforamerica.org/pages/opendata">1000+ open data sets</a>, instituted <a href="http://brigade.codeforamerica.org/pages/openimpact-government">progressive policies</a>, created <a href="http://www.newurbanmechanics.org/">departments for innovation</a> and found new ways to engage citizens and staff. Says Co-Director of Philadelphia's <a href="http://www.newurbanmechanics.org/philadelphia">MONUM</a> Jeff Friedman, "The Fellows were like mysterious strangers that came into my city and taught us we had the magic in us all along."
