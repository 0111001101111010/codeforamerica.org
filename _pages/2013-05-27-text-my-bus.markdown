Led by city contact Karla Henderson and built during the 2011 Fellowship year for the City of Detroit's Department of Transportation fellows Matt Hampel, Alicia Rouault and Prashant Singh, built Text My Bus to relay real-time transit information to Detroit commuters.

TextMyBus provides a simple text messaging service to relay real time transit information to riders. In an environment where Detroiters are faced with cold winters, dangerous street corners, and broken street lights, TextMyBus provides critical information to anyone with a phone that has text messaging capability. DDOT riders simply text in their closest intersection or street address to 50464 and receive a list of routes that service nearby bus stops. Riders then select the route they’d like and find out the live arrival-time predictions.

Launched in September 2012, the app received 1400 users on launch day and continues to serve the community. The project has since received funding from the US Economic Development Administration’s Strong Cities, Strong Communities and the National Center for Safe Routes to School.
