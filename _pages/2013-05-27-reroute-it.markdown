Understanding the impacts of our transportation choices is difficult. We can grasp the cost of a ride on public transit because we pay for individual trips, but we donâ€™t have a directly comparable sense of cost every time we drive off in a vehicle we already own. We also know that it is better for the environment and healthier to walk than it is to drive, but calculating all of these factors is very difficult. Reroute.it makes it easy. Calculating and understanding many of the impacts of our transportation choices is now as simple as getting driving directions on your mobile phone.
