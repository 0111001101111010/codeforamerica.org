Google Summer of Code is a great way to get involved with Code for America. Find out more from Google about the <a href="https://developers.google.com/open-source/soc/">GSoC program</a>.

Code for America's GSoC program is being run by Mick Thompson &lt;mick at codeforamerica.org&gt;. Email him with any questions.

Throughout the program we encourage you to discuss your ideas on our github: <a href="https://github.com/codeforamerica/dev">https://github.com/codeforamerica/dev</a> start a new <a href="https://github.com/codeforamerica/dev/issues">issue</a> to discuss your proposal. 

<strong>Students</strong>

Student application period opens April 22 and ends on May 3.

Here is what we are looking for in a proposal:
<ul>
	<li>A clear concrete idea along with the tasked needed to make the idea a success.</li>
	<li>Tell us about you. Show use what you have done in the past so we can see you are able to complete the project</li>
	<li>Provide a schedule with major milestones so your mentor knows when to expect things to be done.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Ideas:</h3>

Extend an existing Code for America project, or work on something reusable for civic developers. See a <a href="https://github.com/codeforamerica/dev/blob/master/gsoc2013.md"> list of ideas on github</a> Then please discuss your proposal in that github repo by starting a new <a href="https://github.com/codeforamerica/dev/issues">issue</a>
