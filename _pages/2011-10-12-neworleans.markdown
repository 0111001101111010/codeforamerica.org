<h4>The Brigade</h4>
New Orleans plays host to a number of tech organizations including <a href="http://gwob.org/&quot;">Geeks Without Borders</a>. Events like <a href="http://hackforchange.org/new-orleans">Hack for Change New Orleans</a> have been tremendously successful and new programs continue to emerge.

<h4>The 2012 Fellowship in New Orleans</h4>
Blighted and abandoned properties are more than just eyesores -- they attract crime and decrease property value. In 2012, the City of New Orleans had more than 35,000 derelict and abandoned properties with little information to track their demolition or restoration. Citizens who wanted blight-related information could either spend hours on the phones with City Departments or wade through a series of confusing websites.

A woman named Rita Legrand went so far as to attend 400 property code violation hearings hoping that administrative judges would do something in her community. When asked to create a public record of blighted properties, government officials estimated the project would take three years to build and would cost millions of dollars.

In six weeks, Code for America fellows <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/2012-fellows/">Amir Reavis-Bey, Eddie Tejeda, Alex Pandel and Serena Wales</a> joined city officials Allen Square and Denise Ross and built <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/?cfa_app=blightstatus">Blightstatus</a>.

What was originally slated to be a multiyear, multimillion dollar effort became something that brought community members together. The apps was so successful that it was accepted as a Code for America <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/incubator-2/">incubator company</a> and has since spun into a startup called <a href="http://civicinsight.com/">CivicInsight</a>.

Other apps that emerged from the fellowship year include a <a href="http://www.nola.gov/ready/">disaster preparedness program</a> and a <a href="https://github.com/amirbey/doctosoc">tool to sync open datasets</a> to the <a href="https://data.nola.gov/">data.nola.gov</a>.
