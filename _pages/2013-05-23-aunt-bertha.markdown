Aunt Bertha picks up where Uncle Sam left off by simplifying the search and application process for social services. The app collects information on federal, state, county, city, neighborhood and nonprofit programs and puts it all in one place.

In just a few seconds, users can enter basic information and find programs relevant to their needs. Currently, Aunt Bertha has rolled out this search service to the State of Texas (roughly 1/12 of the American population) and is preparing to scale nationwide. More than 17,000 people have already used <a title="http://auntbertha.com" href="http://auntbertha.com">AuntBertha.com</a>.
