Named after the Hawaiian word for family, the <a href="http://ohanapi.org/">Ohana API</a> provides any city or county with an open-source framework for opening up a dataset of community-based organizations, and keeping the information up to date. The API can also fuel economic development as it allows anyone to build applications on top of the data. <a href="http://smc-connect.org">SMC-Connect</a>, an open-source website that allows the residents of San Mateo County to easily find the services they are eligible for, is an example of what can be created using the API.

Both the API and SMC-Connect were developed by 2013 <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/cities/sanmateocounty">San Mateo County Code for America fellows</a> Anselm Bradford, Moncef Belyamani and Sophia Parafina for San Mateo Countyâ€™s Human Services Agency (HSA), with funding from the Philanthropic Ventures Foundation.<br><br>

The API's first third-party <a href="https://github.com/marks/ohana-sms">SMS app</a> is currently in development.
