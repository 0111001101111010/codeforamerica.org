<h2>DEPLOY AN APP. HELP BUILD THE CIVIC WEB.</h2>
<h3></h3>
<h3>ADOPT-A-HYDRANT</h3>
Built for Boston, this map based web app lets individuals and groups assist firefighters by claiming responsibility for shoveling out hydrants during winter snowstorms.

Written to function as a platform, the app can been re-purposed for any kind of civic infrastructure. Because it's open source, it can be improved by a community of practice. In Chicago,  the app's capabilities were extended to include regions in addition to points. This led to <a title="City of Chicago site for Chicago Shovels" href="http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/mayor/snowportal/chicagoshovels.html" target="_blank">Chicago Shovels</a>, an app for adopting sidewalks.
<h3>PUBLIC ART APP</h3>
Initially developed in Philadelphia, the <a title="app home page" href="publicartapp.mobi" target="_blank">Public Art App</a> makes it simple and fun to explore the public art in your city by pulling user-submitted information to create an interactive public art map for any city.

Also written to function as a platform, the app can been re-purposed to map other things. In Oakland, it's used to <a title="99atms.com" href="http://99atms.com/" target="_blank">map the locations of ATMs that's don't charge fees</a>.
