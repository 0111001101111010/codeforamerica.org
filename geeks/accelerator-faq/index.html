                    <h4>What do I have access to through the Accelerator?</h4>

                    <p><strong>Training and mentorship:</strong> You'll receive training from a variety of leaders in the technology and public administration space. Last year’s startups had a 10:1 mentor ratio, and mentors spent over 200 hours with the companies on topics such as sales, lead generation, UX, marketing, product and fundraising. </p>

					<p><strong>Network and publicity:</strong> Access to CfA’s extensive government network, including an opportunity to present, as well as participate in the Civic Tech Fair at the <a href="codeforamerica.org/summit">2014 CfA Summit</a>. Your team will receive 3 tickets to the Summit, which included over 80 governments in 2013. </p>

					<p><strong>In-kind services and support:</strong> Access to product credits and training from some of our <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/supporters/" title="Supporters — Code for America">donors and sponsors</a></p>

                    <h4>Where would I be working?</h4>

					<p>Startups have access to our coworking space and meeting rooms. Every month for the course of the program, you'll convene at <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/IqhhH">Code for America HQ in downtown San Francisco</a> for a week of mentorship, meetings and training. Many teams travel back and forth between SF and their hometowns for the duration of this program.</p>


                    <h4>Will I receive funding from the Accelerator?</h4>

                    <p>Startups receive $25,000 USD per team to grow their businesses.</p>
					<p>As is customary with many Accelerators, our investment stake will depend on the stage and structure of the company, and will be determined prior to acceptance of any company in the Accelerator. </p>

                <div class="layout-gutters isolate">

                    <h4>What type of companies are you looking for?</h4>

					<p>We are seeking civic startups that help to further Code for America’s mission to help cities use modern technology tools and approaches to foster collaboration with their community, improve internal government processes and service delivery, and more effectively and efficiently address community needs.</p>

					<p>We’re especially excited to work with companies that have a defined focus on issues that matter to cities and communities such as improving public health outcomes, increasing access to affordable housing, or driving economic development.</p>

					<p>For example, those that help governments drive transparency, accountability, and community engagement; draw on the knowledge, skills, and experiences of community members; leverage open data; or create easy, convenient, and effective access to public services and information. </p>

					<h4>Is my company eligible to apply?</h4>

					<p>This year, the Accelerator is open only to companies selling directly to the government in the United States. CfA encourages international companies to connect with us at startups@codeforamerica.org. </p>

					<p>Additionally, preference will be given to applicants who:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Sell directly, but not necessarily exclusively, to government</li>
						<li>Are products/services focused vs. consulting oriented</li>
						<li>Have generated some amount of revenue from customers</li>
					</ul>

					<p>We encourage for-profit and non-profit companies to apply, however in prior classes the majority have been for-profit companies.</p>
