        <h2>The 2012 Fellowship in Boston</h2>
    </header>
    
    <div class="layout-gutters">
    
        <p>In 2011, The City of Boston applied for the fellowship program with Microsoft as their community partners. Given a strong Office of New Urban Mechanics, the 2011 fellows Joel Mahoney, Karla Macedo and Talin Salway knew they were dealing with powerful allies. That being said, when the city requested “backpack apps” (an education API and developer platform) — they received so much more.</p>
        
        <p>Apps created during that fellowship year help teachers send students text reminders, help parents track the school bus in realtime and help students and parents assess their school eligibility.</p>
        
        <p>The DiscoverBPS app has been heralded by the Washington Post as a true feat. Fellows built the still popular application in only 2 months with the bulk of the work falling on the shoulders of developer Joel Mahoney. The app has since been taken over by the City of Boston’s IT department.</p>
        
        <p>Some of the other apps built that year include a developer collaboration platform, tool that turns spreadsheets into APIs, mobile app that locates wifi points and a tool that looks a bit like Foursquare for snow-covered fire hydrants called Adopt-a-hydrant.  While “Adopt-a” may seem specific to Boston, it’s since been redeployed to storm drains in Seattle and tsunami sirens in Honolulu.</p>
