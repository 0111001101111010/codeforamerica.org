                <p>CodeAcross 2014 is a weekend of events taking place in cities around the world. There will be events hosted simultaneously in dozens of cities all around the globe on the weekend of February 21-23, 2014. Coinciding with <a href="http://opendataday.org/">International Open Data Day</a>, the goal of CodeAcross is to activate the Code for America network and inspire residents everywhere to get actively involved in their community.</p>
                <p>CodeAcross events will be hosted by members of the CfA network: Fellows, government partners, and volunteers. This is the third annual CodeAcross event (formerly Code Across America).</p>
				<p>This year, we’re offering a theme for CodeAcross: Beyond Transparency. Let’s take the open government movement one step further, by focusing on not only making data open, but actionable. Join us to push the ball forward in your community.</p>
				<p>Who Should Get Involved?: Urbanists, Civic Hackers, Government Staff, Developers, Designers, etc. — anyone with the passion to make their city better.</p>

                <p>Fellows are professionals from the software development, design, research, and urban planning fields who spend a year with us working intensively with a US city. They gain an in-depth understanding of local government and forge deep relationships with their city partners. Most continue civic hacking after the year is over.</p>
