                <p>CodeAcross 2014 is a weekend of events taking place in cities around the world. There will be events hosted simultaneously in dozens of cities all around the globe on the weekend of February 21-23, 2014. Coinciding with <a href="http://opendataday.org/">International Open Data Day</a>, the goal of CodeAcross is to activate the Code for America network and inspire residents everywhere to get actively involved in their community.</p>
                <p>CodeAcross events will be hosted by members of the CfA network: Fellows, government partners, and volunteers. This is the third annual CodeAcross event (formerly Code Across America).</p>
				<p>This year, we’re offering a theme for CodeAcross: Beyond Transparency. Let’s take the open government movement one step further, by focusing on not only making data open, but actionable. Join us to push the ball forward in your community.</p>
				<p>Who Should Get Involved?: Urbanists, Civic Hackers, Government Staff, Developers, Designers, etc. — anyone with the passion to make their city better.</p>

				<p><strong>What is “Beyond Transparency?” </strong>Beyond Transparency is a call to action for local governments, civic technologists, and the community “to examine what is needed to build an ecosystem in which open data can become the raw materials to drive more effective decision-making and efficient service delivery, spur economic activity, and empower citizens to take an active role in improving their own communities.”</p>
				<p><strong>Does Code for America have any suggestions for what to do at my event? </strong>We sure do! We will be releasing the &#8220;Beyond Transparency Challenges&#8221; in early January. You can use these challenges in any way you&#8217;d like&#8211;from orienting your entire event around them to using them as just one of the opportunities for attendees to participate.</p>
