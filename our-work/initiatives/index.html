		<h3>A critical interaction point</h3>
				
		<p>Cities' main websites are the online equivalent of city halls. Residents expect to be able to go there to do all of their government business in one place. For local government staff, providing this is easier said than done. Code for America is working with several US cities to rethink the city website from both sides.</p>

		<h3>The Foundation for Change</h3>
		
		<p>Government purchasing rules almost make it inevitable that local governments will be poorly served by their technology vendors. We are working to shift the dynamic, pilot new models, and bring new vendors into the ecosystem.</p>
