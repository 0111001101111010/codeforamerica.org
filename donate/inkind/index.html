                <p>A wish list of what Code for America needs is listed below, but if there’s something you have you think we could use — a ping pong table? an old Atari? — don’t hesitate to let us know.</p>

                    <h3><strong>Video Streaming, cameras, audio and podcasting equipment</strong></h3>

                    <p>Education and documentation is a big part of our programs. We’ll be bringing in technology and government leaders to speak and present to our members onsite throughout the year. Our fellows are also regularly documenting their events and meetings. We'd love to extend the learning experience to others. If you have stellar videography equipment, can offer cameras to our fellows or you're willing to offer in-kind editing and coverage -- we'd love the support.</p>

                    <p>We spend a lot of time on the computer and used a variety of tools that are necessary for us to fulfill our mission. Donations of the following are always welcome: laptops, mobile devices, cameras, design software, GIS software, cloud services, web hosting services, etc.</p>

                    <p>With a dynamic space and a month of traveling, we’re expecting everyone will be carrying around their laptops, but it’d be good to have a way for everyone to sit down with a monitor and keyboard and get some work done. If you have lots, a couple, or even just one to spare, do let us know.</p>

                    <p>We've got a coder's den with very little furniture in our basement. We can mix and match, so if you have any spare couches or lounge chairs please let us know. Please contact us at info[at]codeforamerica.org for more info.</p>
